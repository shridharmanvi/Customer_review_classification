This is the most soft and luxurious blanket! It melts like butter when you surround yourself with it. It keeps you warm and feels so good against your skin. Wonderful blanket!|5
Bought this for ourselves and are really pleased with it. Enough so, that we wouldn't hesitate to buy one as a gift. Soft, warm, and cuddly.|5
This throw is gorgeous!!! Deep, rich colors and so,so soft. The sale price was fantastic. Highly recommend.|5
Purched 2 twin Velvet Plush blankets to use as bedspreads in my guest room.
Very vibrant color, snuggly soft, much better than I expected for the price.
Was able to find same color window coverings in store. My room has a bright, happy look.|5
Great deal. Worth the buy. Looks just like the picture|5

I was looking for something coral to give me that pop of color and these beautiful pillow did it. They are great quality and are nice and fluffy!|4
I bought this blanket a couple weeks ago and washed it 3 times and black fuzz balls are still falling off of it and going everywhere. I have black fuzz over all my clothes. This blanket is horrible quality.|1
Feel very pleased with this item! Now that winter is here, I feel very happy to buy it. A very good item. Love it.|5
Soft, warm, and cuddly. Would definitely purchase again for myself or as a gift.|5
Bought this as a baby blanket...bad idea. This blanket sheds, sheds, sheds...it's been washed twice and still producing tons of lint in the dryer. Hoping it stops b/c it is beautiful and soft as silk and I'd love to be able to use it!|3
I ordered this online and when it arrived, the Doc McStuffins character was already peeling off bag. I will be returning it to the store!|1
I purchased these curtains (in steel blue) today to match an existing bedroom comforter. It matches perfectly and adds just enough color to the room. They provide some shading while allow in some sunlight to shine through. The color on the package is the true color of the curtains. Great buy.|5
Exactly what I wanted, looks great in my bathroom. Love the variety of curtains online and in the store. Very impressive. S&H was a little much though.|5
I bought these panels for my living room and they look fantastic. The price was right, they were delivered on time and they look great!|5
I bought these gorgeous curtains about a month ago. They are great, light comes through nicely. They are not that wide but they are perfect for my windows.|5

Beautiful black window panel with grey flowered design makes it more pretty|5
Thgese curtains are beautiful and look great at my windows.|5
I truly thank Burlington.com for having every color in sheers that i was looking for my rooms looks good and i will be ordering more soon i have told my family in Memphis,Tn thanks again.....|5
I saw these curtains and I knew I had to purchase them! I am very pleased with my order|5
These are so much better than I expected....ordered 11 pairs...Very classy looking ...well pleased.|5
The curtains were not as dark yellow as in the picture but they still worked out great.|4
Bought all they had at store and then needed two more, so glad for online site.|5
I needed new bedroom curtains to"lighten up" my look.I wanted a nice light weight curtain with a bit of a design.I also wanted a grommet top.I couldn't find the right look for the right price anywhere so I thought I'd give Burlington online a shot.These curtains are perfect! They were a little narrower than some I'd seen so I just got extra.Love them.|4
They are nice panels, at a great price. But they are not black out though they do keep the cold out nicely. My window is 102 inches wide. I used 3 sets. I have another set to add that might make it better. Other black out sets i have had are entirely blackout, without having to buy extra sets so they bunch up and the fabric overlaps to make a blackout.|4
I had previously purchase the same curtain for 1 window..had been to 2 burlingtons looking for the same color... an off white / ivory. Never found it so decide to take a chance an order online..the curtain I received is a tan color. Cant have one window w white & one window w tan . Will be returning|2
I ordered 2 panels as that was all there was, could have used 4, but it works.|3
I return the curtains looked nothing like the picture. This company needs to have better product detail and a zoom in view of product.|1
Arrived in a timely manner. Looks great. Looks great in the apartment along with the other planter purchased.|5
Arrived in a timely manner. Looks great in the apartment. Well made.|5
I love the way this little stands look in front of my patio door. The plants help bridge the view from outside to inside.|5

We normally don't review items but we were so impressed with this dresser that we had to share!
We purchased this dresser for our nursery. The first one came in the mail and as we took it out of the box we noticed a few pieces were broken, so we returned it to the store and re-ordered. So glad we did! The second one came and it was perfect. The color online is very close to the actual color. The size is PERFECT for the nursery. It has a slight sheen to the finish but doesn't look cheap. It took my husband less than 30 minutes to assemble and he only needed a screwdriver to attach the knobs/handles. We haven't put it to use yet but as of now we couldn't be happier with this purchase.|5
We bought this dresser for a changing table/dresser for our new grandson. Honestly the box sat in your foyer for at least a week , putting off putting it together. When we tackled it, it was so easy to put together and was a sturdy, beautiful dresser!|5
Shipping was fast and it only took my husband 30 minutes to put together! Super easy assembly! Looks nice and appears pretty sturdy. Roomy drawers and nice, different color. Can't wait to put the matching crib together to see the pieces together.|5

I was looking for this toy box on line and found that Burlington had the best deal. Before this I wouldn't have thought to look at Burlington. It also arrived in a few days, good shipping. I like that the toy box has small drawers on the bottom. Just right for Legos.|5
It holds a lot of toys and is very sturdy. It fits nicely in our living room.|5
Love it!!! Very spacious for lots of toys (large and small) and I like the bottom bins for the little toys. Happy that they are just under it and not attached it makes it easier for the kids to put away. Used by two rambunctious two year old boys.|5
This is my 15 month old's first toddler bed. It was easy to assemble and was in great condition and looked just like the online images. She absolutely loves her big girl bed. This is the only reasonably priced toddler bed that was high quality and in the natural wood color that we liked. I would purchase it again 100x over.|5
It looks more expensive than it is. Very fashionable and clean. The assemble took sometime and was NOT clear enough (I had to disassemble a few parts because the images were not clear). Also, I must say that it doesn't see like it has the best back support but with a great mattress at this age it should be fine.|5

This bookshelf is very well made and just beautiful. It looks hand-picked and hand-carved. For the price it is a great deal. The shelves are wide and strong. The drawer below is a nice feature. The only thing I wish the drawer had were tracks because it just goes in the slot with no tracks.|5
It doesn't take up to much room. I'm very pleased with this|5

Everything about the chair we purchased met or exceeded our expectations. It has the appearance of regular furniture but sized for a child. Our granddaughter loves it.|5
A great buy. I bought one for my son in store and 2 more this Christmas for my nephews. They love it. It is the perfect size for a toddler. I just wish they had more color options|5
I bought this 2 weeks ago, love them. Everyone compliments me on them|5
I bought this about a month ago and I've received so many compliments on it. I recommend this 100%.|5
It was shipped on time and I love the beds for my girls|5
We bought this dresser for our baby room..It was a great desision|5
Nice and sleek. Coordinates with my real leather furniture.|5
We bought these for our children for Christmas and the one was busted and the other wont recline. I was looking to exchange them and they are now out of stock.|1
Very nicely made & good strong quality product. My kids really liked it & easy to clean|5
Great Quality. Just imagine adult furniture shrunk down to kid size. Adorable!!|5
I bought this for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday...she loves it and I love it....very sturdy and made so well....so beautiful.....very happy with this purchase....|5
My granddaughter lovesi t. She watches TV. on it and just sits on the chair. It is everything I was expecting.|5
I ordered this for my granddaughter to put in my parents house so she would have her "own chair". We all love it so much that I ordered another one for my house.|5
I bought this chair for my son and he absolutely loves it! This is a great chair for a great price!!|5
I purchased the rocking chairs for Christmas presents for my twin grandsons because they are low to the floor and I had bought one years ago for my other grandson and he loved it and used it everyday up to until he turned 6. I hope they get as much use out of them also.|5
My son loves this bed - it's great quality and very sturdy. Looks great in his room|5
It's the perfect size and seems to be very well made|5
It's the perfect size and seems to be very well made|5
I purchased this desk for my 10 year old grandson because of the bookcase feature and it was a great solution for his smallish bedroom. The desk fits him perfectly and the bookcase holds the books he is interested in now. It won't accommodate every book he owns but it is adequate for what he is reading now and has read recently. It was easy to assemble and seems to be sturdy. Excellent choice for his room.|5
I love this table and chair set in my daughter's room, it is so lovely in white and seems really strong. It's a great size, not too big and not too small. She is almost 2 and loves to sit and color and have tea parties on it and I expect it will last well for many years.|5
Bought about a week ago still standing strong. Daughter loves it.|5
Love this vanity - doesn't take too much room - perfect for a child - easy to assemble - sturdy good quality wood - recommend this vanity...|5
Having this changing table has been such a relief on my back! And it matches our Dream On Me folding crib beautifully, too.|5
We cannot believe the quality.
It is heavy so the stools do not tip and the table is large and feels much more expensive than it was. Colors are bright and fun. There is truly no other set like this one.
I love this company called LOLLY&ME.....They seem to really get design and value.|5
I was very pleased with the chair that I purchased! The price was right and the chair was more then what I expected! It just right for the little children. Thank you! I hope to purchase another one in the near future.|5
It shipped quickly and it was exactly what I was looking for. You can't beat the price and I'm so excited to give it to my 1 year old for Christmas. It's the perfect size.|5
This was better quality than I thought it would be for the money granddaughter loved it|5
Darling fabric--pink gingham--seems sturdy, wood legs, good sise for a 1-3 yr old. Only thing that should be different is to have a sturdy backing underneath the fabric in the back-- could puncture easily through fabric.|4
I bought this chair upholstered in denim for my 18 mo old daughter for Christmas. I am very impressed with the quality if material. The denim is a heavy weight dark indigo. It reads more modern and less country (which we like.) The upholstery is tight. No wrinkles. The foam is firm and smooth. The construction is sturdy. The price is a bonus too! The best value around!|4
I bought this chair for my Grandson for Christmas. I could not believe the quality of this chair for the price I paid. It is very well built, looks like I paid much more for it and my Grandson loves it!|5
This chair is everything it says it is. Very nice construction - material is nice and taut on the chair. Can't wait to give it to my nephew for Christmas - he will love it.|5
Love this chair. Very sturdy. My 2 year old loves to kick back in it|5
Super cute and great construction!!! Can't wait to give it to my granddaughter!!!|5
It really looks pretty cheaply made and there are several flaws|3
This sofa is great, so comfy, cute, affordable my daughter loves it!|5
I Bought this for my 1 year old grandson for Christmas. It is adorable. I know he will love it.|5
I was looking for a small chest of drawers with open space below, and this piece fits the bill perfectly! Easy to assemble (just screw in legs and base), attractive (buttermilk off-white color with nice dark hardware), and low profile (13" deep). Good value for the money!|5
This is a nice table. Quality material, not cheap particle board. Easy to put together, just screw the legs and bottom shelf on. The drawers stick a bit and it's a little wobbly but overall it's a good piece. I had my eye on this piece at other stores, but Burlington had the best price. Shipping was fine, came on time with no damage. I'd recommend this product if you're considering it.|4
we got the bed in great time,it was a gift for our grandson,he loved it! we are absolutely pleased in the overall experience with shopping online with burlington coat factory!!!|5
Easy to put together, took me about 30 mins to do so. My little one loves it. I have even later on it a few times to put her to sleep and is sturdy.|5
Nice Bed fairly easy to put together but had a problem with some of the screws not fitting so far it's been no problem|4
I bought this toddler bed 2 weeks ago and was so happy with it! I couldn't believe the amazing quality and style.|5
took no time to get to me, easy to put together and once i did, my 1 y/o loved it!|4
I was disappointed in the quality of the bed. It's doesn't seem too sturdy. But for a little one around 26 pounds, it will be fine. The bed itself also had some scratches and wood pealing off. But the damage was on the back side of the bed, so we will always keep that part against the wall.|3

This was my second Pkolino chair purchase. It was bought for one of my grandson's first birthday. He already loves sitting in it. (His almost three year old brother loves his own Pkolino chair). Well constructed and better quality than many of the cartoon type character chairs out in the market. Fabric seems pretty durable. And all this is at a reasonable price. I highly recommend it. Several people asked at the birthday party, "where can I get one?"|5
The design, color, and quality of this chair is great, but the description says it won't topple over which is not true. I have to hold the chair in place when my son goes to sit in it. It's so light that it moves when he moves in it, and if he reaches for something the chair goes with him. I'm anticipating a fall one day.|4
It is smaller than expected but otherwise very nice|4

The denim does rub off onto the wall and it's not really stain resistant like description says. So we will just scotch guard them and keep them away from wall when in use. Very cute and sturdy frame and my boys 2 & 4 love them|4
It gets dirty pretty fast but my daughter now enjoys getting in and out of it.|5
Christmas present for our Grandaughter....Loved it!|4
I bought this bed to make more space in my guest room/office. I ordered on Monday and bed arrived on Fri. Assembly instructions were clear. It wasn't too bad to put together although it took a bit of finagling to get the slats to stay in the back of the frame while the sides were connected to the back. I managed to do it alone in 2 hours. The color is warm (not as dark as suggested in online photos) and the wood grain quite nice. Burlington had the best price I could find online. I am happy with the purchase.|4
It was delivered on Saturday, was easy to put together, and I'm pleased with the results.|4
I recently purchased this espresso colored daybed. It is beyond my satisfaction. The reviews were very positive so I decided to purchase the bed. It was easy to put together and it looks amazing. Definite one to not fear purchasing.|5
This is a very nice piece of furniture. It does take a bit of time to put together, but for the price it's worth it compared to what you've pay for pre-assembled furniture. The color is as dark as the picture shows, very very deep brown, in case you want to match a crib to the color. The long part of the of table to large enough to fit a change pad. Overall happy with the purchase.|4
It's a nice, simple nightstand. For some reason I thought it was wood but it's not. Still, it's for the nursery so it won't get much use. I'm assuming it'll hold up fine. Easy to put together.|4
The toy chest was a bit warped but I got it together and I think it will do just fine. I'm excited that my daughter will be able to enjoy this for a very long time.|4

This chair and ottoman is so cute. It's more pink than lavender in person ~ yet adorable|4
I got this for great nephew, and he loves it. Will have to see how it stands up to wear and tear.|4
I bought this dresser a few weeks ago to go in my nursery. We were looking for something that was a decent price, good quality and a modern look. This dresser definitely fit the bill.My only critic would be that it could be a little more heavy duty but for the price it fulfills what we were looking for.|4
Shipping took a little bit longer than I expected but the price was great for the beautiful bed in the guest room.|4
My husband and I bought this for Christmas for our two girls (2 and 4). Putting it together would have been very easy except for a couple of problems. First, you have to be very careful not to tighten the wood screws that go in the top of the chair back very much. It will split the wood. You can't even get them hand tight. Just enough to hold the pieces together with no gap is all you can do or it starts to crack a little.|4
Best price. My 4 year old loves desk. Good storage n easy to assemble|4
I bought this for my 19 month old daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it and I do too! It's a great size because she can use it now but there is still plenty of room for her to grow and use for a long time to come. She is in it all the time so my mom bought one to keep at her house for my daughter to use when she's over there.|5
I love this little chair. It's adorable. It is actually a bit bigger than I expected which is nice.|5
Did not receive email product had shipped. Took over 2 weeks to receive. Product is hard to clean. Will not be returning to shop there.|1
This is a christmas but I know my grand daughter will love it .It is really cute...|4
My 19 month old daughter received this for Christmas and it's been used daily. This past week, the cushion on the seat has shifted over so a wood support piece is basically exposed and when she sits down, it's right under her. Very disappointed in how long this item lasted.|1
Our son absolutely loves his chair. Only problem we had was it was supposed to be in brown and we got blue, but that was not a big deal. They were very kind and took 10% off to make it better.|5
We bought this chair for a oresent for our 1 year old granddaughter. Cant wait to givd to her. She ttie one out when she sees one in the stores.|5
this is the 3rd chair we purchased, all for one year olds' birthdays!! This chair is so adorable and very light weight, and the kids fit in them just perfect!!!|4
Bought this for a Christmas Present for my daughter. We went away for Christmas so she has literally used it for a week. It already has a small tear it in. Disappointed in the quality of the fabric. My 17 month old loves it though. So we will hold onto it until it totally falls apart.|3
The bed is VERY low to the ground. It's basically on the floor. Not what I imagined|1
Great bed and was very easy to put together. My daughter loves her bed.|5
It was a gift for my grandson he loves that chair to deaf. Just his size.|5
I ordered this chair and it was too small. Not as big as in the picture. I plan to return it.|1
Yes it holds bath tiys but they must be really small in order for the bag to stay on the wall.|3
This is a lovely piece of furniture that looks wonderful in our nursery; the honey oak finish compliments our matching crib and changing table nicely. The piece of furniture itself is solid, and the design is a classic that will grow with the room. The issue we had was with the drawer design. The drawer slides that came with the unit are cheap, and once installed, the drawers are not positioned properly. There is a gap at the top of the drawer. In addition, there is very little support from the slides given to the drawer itself, so it slid out very quickly and would potentially fall out of the main unit; this seems particularly unsafe for a piece of furniture marketed for a child's room. Luckily we were in a position to acquire and install higher quality drawer slides at a minimal cost, which makes the dresser safer and more functional; however, for the base cost of the dresser, having to spend extra to make it functional is slightly disheartening. Overall the dresser is a lovely piece of furniture that unfortunately suffers from some poor design flaws. I would recommend it, but with reservation.|3

I bought this stepstool a couple weeks ago. Came completely disassembled, which was fine. Picture instructions were clear and all parts were there. However, there were two design flaws. One, the inner box floor is extremely thin and could easily be broken with anything remotely heavy stored inside. Secondly, the final pre-drilled holes for the hinges on the lid were not deep enough, and by the time I realized it, I had already stripped the screws. Haven't got around yet to going to the hardware store to buy new screws, drill better holes and re attach lid -- so a bit disappointed. Stool is smaller in width than I expected (I should have done a measurement comparison to older stepstool. The hardwood seems of good quality, the only complaint re the wood I have is the very thin plywood storage box floor.|3
I purchased this as a Christmas Gift to my daughter. It was ordered a week before Christmas with an ETA of 12/28. To my suprise it arrived before Christmas with a couple days to spare. I wished it came in black but I opted to paint it instead. Once done, I discovered I was missing washers and inserts for the seat when putting the vanity together. Rather wait for more hardware from the manufacturer(anticipating my daughters smile), I was left to purchase it at Home Depot. Overall I was very pleased with shipping and the product itself. I wasn't really happy that I had to go out and buy missing hardware.|3
I purchased this for my sons room it took a while to put together , my husband did it all by himself he got the hang of it just follow directions and you will eventually get it done lol . It's pretty flimsy though but I guess for the price it's ok|3
I got this for my 1&1/2 year old daughter for Christmas and she likes it a lot. I was a little disappointed because I didn't realize it was foam and not an upholstered chair. She likes to climb and jump on things which is why we have to have this chair against something or it'll topply over. Also the armrests aren't very steady.|3
I thought it was made of better material. Soft and foamy not as durable as I expected.|2
the pic is deceiving it does not come with a bookshelf.|2
Bought this chair for nursery. It felt comfortable. I added a pillow for back support. Few days later I sat on glider with shorts and short sleeve shirt and I realized how itchy the fabric is. Which is such a bummer. Glider is a bit noisy, maybe it needs to be broken in.|2
I bought this for my adult children. Thinking it was for adults, not children. Not the case!! Disgusted I wasted $89 because they refuse to return it!!|1
Bought this to organize my closet. It's huge, sturdy and of good quality. The price was awesome. Will definitely buy more.|5
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH READY TO BUY SOME MORE.ITS VERY ROOMY. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO A FRIEND.|5
I love this storage tote, it is perfect for the storage of blankets in the family room.|5
I was looking for this toy box on line and found that Burlington had the best deal. Before this I wouldn't have thought to look at Burlington. It also arrived in a few days, good shipping. I like that the toy box has small drawers on the bottom. Just right for Legos.|5
It holds a lot of toys and is very sturdy. It fits nicely in our living room.|5
Love it!!! Very spacious for lots of toys (large and small) and I like the bottom bins for the little toys. Happy that they are just under it and not attached it makes it easier for the kids to put away. Used by two rambunctious two year old boys.|5
Very nice quality - love the colors, materials, etc., but it is a bit slouchy - good and bad. I wish it was a little less flexible and a little more rigid, but it is definitely very nicely made and it adds sophistication to the bottom of my closet and will keep things looking neat!|5
Love this product! Sturdy with quality fabric. Can't wait to get more.|5
Had one and bought a second one to stack on top. Perfect for toys and comes with a bracket for stacking!|5

Bought this for my kitchen counter to act as decor & fruit storage. Looks great & is very roomy - fits approx. 10 apples in the bottom basket & a banana bunch in the top basket. It's sturdy & makes for cute decor piece.|5
It's the perfect little fruit/banana holder. I am able to comfortably fit 3 pieces of fruit underneath the bananas. Keeping fruit on the counter encourages me to stick to a healthy diet.|5
Ordered 20 Post Mardi Gras Recovery Baskets were a HIT!!!!!!! Client absolutely loved them.|5
I have been looking for a flatware tray for quite a while - although I have come across may trays - none can compare to this - it's classy looking, fit into my kitchen drawer with a little room left over (which is no problem) and I am very pleased with my purchase.|5
My daughter loves it. Very sturdy, and storage compartments are a very nice size. Putting it together was a bit tricky because the parts aren't labeled as they are in the instructions.|4
Before Xmas, I looked for this online; it was either out of stock or overpriced. I was extremely happy to find it at BCF for great price and shipping was super fast! Awesome!!!|5

The toy chest was a bit warped but I got it together and I think it will do just fine. I'm excited that my daughter will be able to enjoy this for a very long time.|4

Yes it holds bath tiys but they must be really small in order for the bag to stay on the wall.|3
I bought this product to replace my current trashcan in the kitchen. The box was in good condition, but when we took the trashcan out it had a huge dent on the side. We returned the item.|1
Bought the lamps for the guest bedroom. It really makes the overall room. Receive lots of compliments.|5
My daughter needed cookies to take into work. Of course, that means I was baking. Used this mix and had delicious cookies ready to go in a snap. One-bowl to clean too!|5
I bought three of these cookie mixes for gifts. They came quickly and wrapped so cute. Definitely recommend!|5

This product came well packaged to prevent damage and matches my room perfect!|5
I just hung my picture up and I love it! Not only do I love it but my husband loves it as well. Great purchase!|5
I didn't open any of my purchases until I actually moved today. I opened this and I was in shock! It's very high quality, much more beautiful than it looks online, large size, just gorgeous! I could not be happier! This would have cost a fortune elsewhere! Do not hesitate to purchase. It's a great deal!!|5
I was remodeling my room and wanted something that stood out, but not in a bad way. This clock is beautiful! I get soooo many compliments on it, and for the price it's a great deal!|5
Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|5
Great picture and quality -
Packaging was perfect too- love this new addition to my decor|5
I was looking for an abstract wall art set to mount between my living room windows.|5
I love the metal wine racks! I had been looking around for a while.|5
Had to reorder, because the first one came damaged. The second piece was not damaged, but the colors were not as vibrant. Am thinking of returning again. Realize it is metal work, but the coloring should be the same.|3
I bought this picture about two weeks ago, didn't take long to arrive at all. Beautiful picture but the quality of the frame is very poor. Weighs maybe 5 pounds and there is no glass on the frame which I thought it would be.|3
The photo shows the scroll as black, the description states it as brown; however, it is actually brass/gold. The size and shape was so great that I chose to keep and paint it. After applying a couple coats of antique bronze spray paint, it is up on my wall and I love it!|3
I bought this about a week ago, it is nice but don't go by the picture that's shown. The actual color is like a brownish gold color. Not sure if i'm gonna keep it and just spray paint it or if it is going back.|1
I love the metal wine racks! I had been looking around for a while.|5
Great item. Just what I wanted for summer dining and entertaining.|5
I bought two sets, they arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Very happy with my purchase!|5

I just bought these glasses paid so much and they are plastic|1
We got three of them and we love them, very confortable|5
Brought it 1-14-16 in store. All I want to do is sleep.|5
I got this a week ago and my husband and I have been sleeping so well. Our mattress is a bit old and uncomfortable and this has improved it.|5
The product is very good, good cotton and nice color|5
I bought a set of sheets. I love the the color the feel. They are very comfortable and soft. Great buy!|5
It was exactly what I was looking for!!! Beautiful colors and fits my bed perfectly.|5
This is the most soft and luxurious blanket! It melts like butter when you surround yourself with it. It keeps you warm and feels so good against your skin. Wonderful blanket!|5
Bought this for ourselves and are really pleased with it. Enough so, that we wouldn't hesitate to buy one as a gift. Soft, warm, and cuddly.|5
This throw is gorgeous!!! Deep, rich colors and so,so soft. The sale price was fantastic. Highly recommend.|5
Purched 2 twin Velvet Plush blankets to use as bedspreads in my guest room.
Very vibrant color, snuggly soft, much better than I expected for the price.
Was able to find same color window coverings in store. My room has a bright, happy look.|5
It felt sooo good sleeping on the bed it was like sleeping on a cloud and the shipping was fast too came before the expected date|5
Very nice and comfortable fits my cal-king mattress perfect love it|5
I love these sheets they're so soft and cozy. Makes me real comfortable|5
This throw is gorgeous!!! Deep, rich colors and so,so soft. The sale price was fantastic. Highly recommend.|5
Love the set. I have gotten so many compliments on it already. The grey side is super soft and the fabric is of very nice quality, not cheap or polyester like. Definitely a great bargain.|4
Very nice comforter set! Super soft and the fabric doesn't look like cheap polyester, but beware it DRY CLEAN ONLY! The reverse is a nice shade of grey.|4
Purchased two twin sheet sets (500 thread count). One set had stains on the top sheet the other had stains on the bottom sheet. None of the stain came out after washing. Such a hassle to return things I'll just keep them but would NOT recommend others to purchase. They also wrinkled badly after washing.|1
Very pleased with the sateen sheets, excellent color fabric and queen size fit to the bed|5
Beutiful!!! Love the fabric, the color, the quality. Great product.|5
I bought this blanket a couple weeks ago and washed it 3 times and black fuzz balls are still falling off of it and going everywhere. I have black fuzz over all my clothes. This blanket is horrible quality.|1
Feel very pleased with this item! Now that winter is here, I feel very happy to buy it. A very good item. Love it.|5
Soft, warm, and cuddly. Would definitely purchase again for myself or as a gift.|5
I am picky about the softness and this blanket is kinda scratchy and the design is felt. The pillows are flat and squished. The sheets are soft and nice.|3
Unfortunately, when these sheets arrived, I realized that they were the same as a set I already have and dislike. They look good and wash well, but tI find sleeping on polyester material uncomfortable. Back they went!|3
I originally bought this set at the store however when we got it home it was torn at the seem. We really liked the color as we just painted our accent wall chocolate. We took a chance and ordered it online and when we received it we noticed that it was torn at multiple seams. The material was bad quality and the seams were not sown correctly.|1
The cover and pillow cases looks great and feel great. But tear up easily, material i guess.|2
Not as large as I thought it would be, but my Grandson Loved it. Took a minute to charge and after that he was flying it all over.|4
The price of this product on Burlington's website is good because it is $30 through other vendors. The packaging causes the vinyl to fold funny, but this isn't Burlington's fault. This is a nice indoor toy for a kid, the balls are soft and the game is easy to set up. It's not a tough toy, so if your kids are rough or older, it may not be a good fit for them. But if you have a kid who likes playing catch or you need a toy to take on a trip, this is a great activity to have on hand.|4
Love my new back pack! It has so many compartments enough room for my text books! And laptop!|5
I've had this since September and love it! Everything fits nicely. Has a space for my laptop and tablet|5
We desperately needed a new sturdy backback. This one is designed for comfort and is heavy duty. I bought it for school but he likes to carry it everywhere. There is even a compartment for a laptop. It is so comfortable too! He LOVES it! I am definitely purchasing another one for my youngest son as well. :)|5
Great quality speedy delivery easy to order. I had no issues|5
Great article for a gift and excellent price than the other stores|5
This is a super comfortable and sturdy laptop backpack! I love all the compartments to organize my things, and the padded carrying handle. Great color too!|5
Arrived quickly and it's hilarious and big enough to fit a lot of stuff!|5
I got this for my backpack for school and it last for two years|5
My son is a full-time college student and I felt like he needed something compact but sturdy. It's versatile. It can carry his laptop. Perfect!|5
I was going to give it to my daughter but I ended up keeping myself. the style reminded me of my old backpack as a kid. It has a lot of room for a weekend get away.|5
Bought over a month ago, works perfect in daughters room|5

Price good, delivered in time, overall compare to holiday deals with burlington reasonable|5
I bought this set and fell in love when it arrived. However the measurements of the largest suitcase would have put me over by 2 inches for checked in luggage. It was sad to return the set. Really loved it.|5
I love my new Luggage that my Daughter want a set for her and family.|5
I bought it about a 2 weeks ago for a trip I have to Florida and it's more than expected I'm over the moon with this purchase.|5
I bought this luggage for our honeymoon cruise. It was able to fit all of our things. I love that it comes with the optional sizes. This is what sold me on purchasing the luggage. The handle on the largest suitcase has since bent. I'm going to return it and get a replacement. Overall we like it for the price we paid.|4
I ordered this item and it was not in stock. It took sometime, before they informed me that this item was no longer available. I decided to go to one of the stores and they only had one set of luggage left and it was the Royal Blue assorted luggage's. It was my Blessed day. I am happy that I was able to get it, although I preferred to have the Black Set. it is back on-line again? Afraid to order and find out it is out of stock.|4
I loved it, exactly what i was looking for, great material, would definitely recommend it!!|5
I brought this about a month ago and used it for my first trip and I loved it. The only negative thing is the little lock eventually chipped on me, so I need to get another lock. Overall I am satisfied with my luggage set.|5
I love the varying sizes and the overall design is lovely. For some reason I thought it would be bigger but that is not an issue. For the price it is definitely a great buy.|5
