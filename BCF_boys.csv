I purchased two of these for my 4 and 7 year old boys. They loved the camo! I was disappointed to see that while the tie length was correct for them the neck was too big and the velcro placement didn't allow for a tight enough fit so both of them had the knot of their ties hanging down an inch or two below where they should have been. I sew so I may add additional velcro so they can be tightened up appropriately but I shouldn't need to. Given the price I feel like I had to give two stars rather than one.. I guess I got what I paid for.|2
Not all the socks match in size. He can only wear six out of 10 pairs.|1

The suits I bought for my two ring bearers... the pin stripe was much more blue than the picture and much more busy, however the yellow shirt and bowtie are perfect so I will be using those! Great price for a decent quality!|3
I thought the suit was very nice but every year and day it's the same color black, and it's always the husky sizes that gets no variety of color options. I would like to see a nice light blue or purple, and how about even peach for the spring. Husky size should have different colors too just like the regular sizes.|2

Bought this suit in size 3T. Same size I bought in another suit that fit great! The jacket and shirt were perfect, but the pants were HUGE! You could fit two 3 year olds in the pants. They were labeled 3T, but that could not be accurate! Ended up having to return it all! :(|2
The item was not what I needed. It runs big but does not have value with the pants.|1
I purchased a suit for my great grandson in a size 4T, what I received was a size 4. The price tag on the suit was clearly marked size 4T, after looking at the suit I noticed the tag on the suit was a size 4. At this point I will NEVER order anything from Burlington. I would recommend this to a friend however I would suggest they don't order online.|1
