This is a beautiful coat!!! I'm glad I picked the Tall version for my 6'3" boyfriend. It fits him perfectly except for the waistband, which is a little snug and is not elastic. However, he can still get it zipped and leather, even faux leather, tends to stretch out over time so I'm not worried. There were a few loose threads along the zipper upon arrival, but they were easily removed. It's really soft and very attractive, and hopefully will last a long time.|5
I love this Jacket! It's sad, that other department stores, don't offer amazing choices for Big & Tall. I will cherish this coat for years to come!|5

I bought this for my son as a stocking stuffer, he had been growing a beard since the first of November. Well he went into the bathroom to try it out and shaved nearly all of his face off. He loved the product so much he couldn't stop with the trimming. He looks good with what he has now not the bear he had became.|5
These worked out great! Just what was needed and they will be used. Easier to iron than 100 percent cotton. Should have bought another packet. Arrived in time for the birthday and great quality.|5
This purchase was a Christmas gift for my son. He said he didn't want a bulky scarf and this set was perfect.|5

Bought it loved it.................................|5
Great shirt.....love the quality..my husband love it.|5
This shirt is really good for a casual day at the office or just to wear with a pair of jeans. I am 6,1 tall and about 180lbs. My arms are long sometimes a medium fit my torso but sleeves aren't long enough for my arms. However, this shirt does the job.|5
great price...nice quality...my style...free shipping|5
Looks classy... My XL is on the smallish end of the XL scale but OK.|5
The shirt is slightly over-sized for me but the smaller size would have been too small. Impossible to find perfectly sized shirts, but this one will do.|4
Bought a 4x. Only 2 out of the 20 shirts i bought did not fit me.|2
I bought this for my nephew and he loves it. Fits him great|5
Over all this is of good quality for a good value.|4
i didnt like it when i got it......to thin and wasnt the color i thought it was going to be.|3
Ordered shirt a size larger than usual it was still to small not happy|1
Unbelievable! The Burlington price tag said Sz L but the shirt itself was a XXL!!|1
Ordered shirts a size larger than usual still to small never again..,.|1
I don't know how they size, but I've been wearing 3X for many years and when I tried this and two other shirts that I bought in 3X they all fit like they were "Larges". It was impossible to put them on. I'll never buy clothing online. I did return them to a store which was easy, but I still lost my shipping fees. Not fair!|1
Size not even right I wanting 5xl more just XL no money to seng back|1
It was really great, I loved how many pockets it came with and also the suspenders on the inside to give added support. Over all great coat, just gotta wait to break it in once winter actually starts haha.|5

I bought this jacket as a much needed Christmas gift for my husband. He loves it! It's perfect for those cold drizzly days. Especially since the fur lining on the hood is detachable!|5
This jacket answers the need for warmth. It is stylish and has storage galore. The price was awsome and way lower then what it would cost in retail stores.|5
Got it for brother and dad for their fishing adventures. Quality is great! Warm and they loves it!|5
I bought 2 jackets in black for birthday presents and they loved them,|5
I brought my coat about a month ago and I am totally satisfied|5

We needed a sturdy, warm jacket for an active boy and kids coats were not lasting. This is a sturdy, well built jacket that should last the season.|5
Had this new jacket for about three weeks and very pleased with it and it looks sharp! I bought the blue with black accents.|5
I live the jacket it runs big but I like that since I dress in layers|5
I bought it for my son, he wasn't cold at all when he was standing out in the elements . He is 6'4 and the length of the jacket and arms were perfect|5
Just got it a few weeks ago. It's good and warm and flexible to remove the hood and fur and comfortable to wear. Worth the money.|5
My mom and I purchased this for my brother in AZ. He works outside in the evenings. He says that it is wonderful so far!|5
Bought 5 winter coats for my grandsons and was very happy with the fit and the design also the quality of all 5 coats.|5
I bought this coat as a gift and the person bought for loves it. It's full and warm so it has no need really for any extra layering or anything like that. They also said it's optional to wear a hat because the hood is so warm and full as well. Overall the coat was a great buy and the sizing is accurate and the color (ice) is beautiful!|5
This coat is great! Very warm, great for Winter and looks better in person than online.|5
Fit the boyfriend wonderfully and is still keeping him warm.|5
I bought this jacket for my husband and he loves it.|5

Bought this for Christmas for my grandson, he loves it. The fit was perfect. Perfect for my 15 year old who likes to layer, not bulky, but keeps him warm.|5
The jacket really blocks wind and keeps the cold out. I just wasn't crazy about the hood. It doesn't quite sit right on your head. The pockets are deep too|5
This is a very good coat for any kind of storm around east coast!|5
Very nice price. Runs a little big but you have to wear it in top of your clothes.|5
Not bulky but still warm. Fits true to size. Very nice look. Bought for a teenage boy who loved it|5

I bought it for a gift for my husband, he loves it ,so do I.It is a very nice shirt|5
The shirt, bowtie and suspenders go well together. The suspenders, however, are somewhat difficult to adjust.|4
I am looking forward to getting even more of your box sets Great value.|5
This product is a little big for me but is ok I later give it to my brother|2
bought this expecting your average printed tee but this is actually more of the ironed on graphic so to speak. Every detail is thick and it literally covers the entirety of the front of the shirt from seam to seam the graphic stops just before hitting the back of the shirt and before hitting the sleeves. Great quality for the price will definitely last a long time. Recommend hand wash hang dry to keep in good condition.|5
I had to buy new T-shirts since I lost weight. This one fit the bill.|5
Bought some shirts at good prices and the shipping was fast .|4

Bought this for my husband on father's day and it is an amazing fit. I would recommend getting measured by a tailor to ensure the right size. Only thing I didn't like was the size selection was limited so the pants didn't fit as well as the jacket and will have to be taken in|4
Great suit and can't beat the price..... The sticky/ticky prices are best in market and BCF has a ton of product and inventory !!! No better store in market my only suggestion is, if u see what u want, grab it b/c stuff flys off the shelves b/c of above.....great store !!!|5
Purchased this suit for an interview because blue (navy) is the best color to wear. Landed the job and couldn't have been more confident in this suit!|5

Very Comfortable show......highly recommended......|5
I'm really happy i bought these boots, i don't have to worry about my feet getting wet anymore|5
I like the fact that they are waterproof. and durable. Great price as well.|5
I bought this shoe about 3 weeks ago. My friends liked it & they are shoe very comfortable.|5
I bought these very nice shoes well worth it ! "You Really get Excellent quality"|5
Great quality, nice craftsmanship. Bought them for my Buddy in the black color, even thought the brown look real nice too! They are the perfect combination of rugged and stylish!|5

I just bought these after looking around town for something similar. I am so glad I waited and got these on line. They are exactly what I wanted.|5
I purchase these shoes about 2 months ago in the department store. I bought the brown with orange stitching and the black with red stitching...both pair are great. i bought them for work. They are nice looking, comfortable and casual work, play and go out shoes.|5
Actually was looking for a leather coat but wound up w/shoes.. Fit very well|5
I've gone running with these shoes twice in a week, both times 5 miles plus. They feel good, nice cushion, feet don't hurt after the run. Gotta get a second pair to keep in the closet as a backup.|5
My son really likes them and they fit his big feet.|4
bought these slip-ons for my spouse. He really likes them. They are comfortable and are a nice diversion from sneakers.|4
I bought these for my husband. They aren't fancy boots, but they are really good for everyday living. They are wide and have a spacious, round toebox. They keep out mud, but be warned, they pick up the mud too. Get your boot scraper onto the porch!|4
Can not wear too small. Shoes need to be men sizes.|3
I bought this shoe for the Spring/Summer so it would be unfair for me to review it because I have yet to wear it.|3

My husband wore them yesterday,they fit exactly how he wanted.l liked the blue stripe down the middle of the belt.I was skeptical,because you can't be to sure when it comes to Burlington's men's clothing, their clothing look so big.But,it was fine|5
Lightweight great for summer. I like the snaps on the pockets.|4
Wore these for the first time yesterday and was very happy with the look and feel.|4
Super good value! Best value for the money. I may buy more later|5
This is a great sweater for the guy who likes comfort. The lining adds to the warmth of the item, and the pockets are an added bonus for the guy to carry keys.|5
Good price.........................................|4
bought this expecting your average printed tee but this is actually more of the ironed on graphic so to speak.

Great quality for the price will definitely last a long time. Recommend hand wash hang dry to keep in good condition.|5
I had to buy new T-shirts since I lost weight. This one fit the bill.|5
Fits perfect nice and long.no need to iron out the bag. Want more like these|5
Bought some shirts at good prices and the shipping was fast .|4
I should have purchased a medium the large runs alittle big|4
My husband is a solid XL. I even checked the size chart before I bout it and this was way to big on him. More like a 2 or 3 XL. The style is great! Just make sure u buy a size smaller than u need.|3
I don't know how they size, but I've been wearing 3X for many years and when I tried this and two other shirts that I bought in 3X they all fit like they were "Larges". It was impossible to put them on. I'll never buy clothing online. I did return them to a store which was easy, but I still lost my shipping fees. Not fair!|1
