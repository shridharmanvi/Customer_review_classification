I purchased two of these for my 4 and 7 year old boys. They loved the camo! I was disappointed to see that while the tie length was correct for them the neck was too big and the velcro placement didn't allow for a tight enough fit so both of them had the knot of their ties hanging down an inch or two below where they should have been. I sew so I may add additional velcro so they can be tightened up appropriately but I shouldn't need to. Given the price I feel like I had to give two stars rather than one.. I guess I got what I paid for.|2
Not all the socks match in size. He can only wear six out of 10 pairs.|1
My son is very happy with them love them so much hes happy|5
Love the feel of the material. Sizing was accurate and the item washes well.|5
Love my new back pack! It has so many compartments enough room for my text books! And laptop!|5
I've had this since September and love it! Everything fits nicely. Has a space for my laptop and tablet|5
I bought this suitcase for my 4 year old son and he loved it. It's small enough he can carry it himself but large enough to carry a couple suits of clothes and his toys.|5
The luggage was delivered 2 days early and in good condition. The luggage passed with flying colors. Very durable I love it.|5
Bought this for my grandson for a Christmas gift. They are going to Disney in January, It should be great for him!|5
Colors are beautiful and it's a great size for children. We bought it for my 8 year old nephew and he loves it.|5
I bought a small lugagge for my kid. It was an execellent deal!|5
My nephew loved the suitcase, but Burlington needs to do a better job in the packing department. It had a few scratches on the back part of the case. Unfortunately, I opened the box with my nephew and he didn't care about the scratches like I did.|4

I bought the double jacket to replace a similar one my son had for 2 years n grew out off. When he put it on one 32 degree day, said wow really warm, n loved it. Best Buy and very versatile.|5
Great Coat; the 3-1 feature allows him an option to wear the coat and the vest or just the vest with a hoodie|5

I bought this for my son. Jacket is much better looking than the pic shows. Seems warm and looks nice.

The suits I bought for my two ring bearers... the pin stripe was much more blue than the picture and much more busy, however the yellow shirt and bowtie are perfect so I will be using those! Great price for a decent quality!|3
I thought the suit was very nice but every year and day it's the same color black, and it's always the husky sizes that gets no variety of color options. I would like to see a nice light blue or purple, and how about even peach for the spring. Husky size should have different colors too just like the regular sizes.|2
I bought this suite for my son first holy communion and it was true to size and a true husky size|5
I am looking for a navy blue husky size 16 suit for my son. I thought I had hit the jackpot but glad I read the decription.|3
I bought this suit for my son after reviewing the size chart. It's about 3 sizes smaller then the chart said it should be.|1

Bought this suit in size 3T. Same size I bought in another suit that fit great! The jacket and shirt were perfect, but the pants were HUGE! You could fit two 3 year olds in the pants. They were labeled 3T, but that could not be accurate! Ended up having to return it all! :(|2
The item was not what I needed. It runs big but does not have value with the pants.|1
I purchased a suit for my great grandson in a size 4T, what I received was a size 4. The price tag on the suit was clearly marked size 4T, after looking at the suit I noticed the tag on the suit was a size 4. At this point I will NEVER order anything from Burlington. I would recommend this to a friend however I would suggest they don't order online.|1
Not only is this a beautiful coat, it is also warm. I purchased this for my 83 year old aunt who needed a warm coat that had a nice lining and that she could wear a sweater with; this coat fits the bill. Love it!! Would highly recommend.|5
I bought this a few weeks ago when it wasn't very cold so I didn't wear it. The cold weather set in and it's comfortable, warm, and to my surprise had the thumb hole cutouts in the grey part of the cuff. I won't be cold in this coat. It's one of the few partial down filled coats I could find for the price I paid. Love it!|5
I've been wearing the same coat since 2007, while searching for another option that's just as warm. This coat is a pleasant surprise. I was too hot in it, one cool day. It's fashionable and functional. Love the double zipper and fur-like lining on the wrists and upper back.|5
Very good buy price is right and very warm and love it, you won't be disappointed|5
I like the color. I am a little over 5 feet so it fits long but it's warm.|5
Love love love love it.... what you see is definitely what you get|5
It fits as expected. Will be warm and cozy ! Nice purchase.|5
Coat is super comfortable and warm! And stylish too :)|5
This coat is not bulky but it's warm. The hood can be tightened so if it's very windy it won't blow off your head. Just a great looking and functional cost.|5
I bought this coat about a month ago and I just love it. It is so warm and so very comfortable. It is true to size, it fits great. It really is waterproof and the hood is lined so I don"t have to wear a hat on those cold, cold winter nights. This is by far the best winter coat I have ever owned.|5
i bought this a few weeks ago and i am tremendously pleased. Size is perfect and comfortable. Hood is also great addition to warm lightweight jacket.|5
Really like it. The way it fits glad I got a size bigger.|5
This is a beautiful coat. I sew so am making the hood a collar as i dont like hoods But is is very thick and nice faux fur I am thinking of buying another one at this price|5
My wife has received so many compliments on her coat and it keeps her nice and warm. It looks so rich and like the real thing.|5
I bougth it for my wife and she was very, very happy.|5
I've worn it daily since I got it and love it. Great color and weight!|5
I've been looking for a coat like this for a long time and finally found it at Burlington. Very stylish, comfortable and practical. It can be worn in all seasons. The only thing I would have changed is snaps instead of buttons, as this is a classic raincoat and the buttons will probably fall off before it's worn out!|5
This coat came beautifully packaged. It is lightweight but because of the lining provides warmth as well. You can zip it closed, snap it closed or both. The lining comes out for warmer weather wear. I love coats with hoods. This one can also be detached. Great purchase and nice quality for the reasonable price!|5
Runs large, can't return in store, will keep you warm for sure.|3
This 3 in 1 jacket was exactly what I was looking for. The colors are vibrant, the fit perfect, the materials high quality, and the style versatile to accommodate winter temp ranges. It keeps me toasty warm in the coldest of Minnesota days. Bottom line is that I love it!|5
I needed a good warm jacket and hadn't bought one in years. Hated going to stores. This was perfect. And I can take it apart when the weather is warmer. Great!|5
Great jacket that's has removable inner shell that can be worn. Very warm!|5
Fit great looked great and fair price! Big selection to choose from, price wise as well.|5
Nice looking jacket for any occasion, light enough to befor summer also|5
I was looking for this coat because I liked it int he other store, but they had only 2 sizes larger. Found in Burlington my size with a great price. But unfortunately it turned too big and I had to return it. Beautiful, lighrweight, but runs large.|5
Happy with coat wished it was available in another color - I would order|5
The lining is really nice to the skin, much warming than I thought on a winding day, and the arm length is what I needed.|5
The silk lining she likes The color combo she loves Durable zipper snaps Thick Affordable|5
I bought this rain coat two weeks ago . I absolutely love it . It's so comfy & flexible and soft , unlike other stiff rain coats . The only this is this one doesn't have hood , but to be comfortable is important to me and its fine I just use my umbrella anyway ! Love Love this coat|5
This coat is amazing it fits comfortably, it warm and it looks great.|5
I live in North-western Wisconsin and I bought this jacket for "in-between" weather. It's great for that! It is very stylish, comfortable, and warm. The gathering in the back gives it a nice shape.|5
I shop Burlington all the time so decided to give the on-line catalog a look to see if they had anything different than the store for coats. I bought this one and have to say that I am so pleased with it. It arrived on time and it fits perfectly. It is hard to find something that runs true to size in the arms and length. I love my new coat! PS, it is very warm.|5
I bought this jacket for my mother and she loved it!|5
I ordered this for my daughter in pink. It's a coral/pink and is lovely! The goldtone appliances add the bit of flash that she likes. The cut is extremely flattering (slightly longer tshirt hem in back) as is the extensive seaming and mesh fabric used in the lower quarter of the jacket. First purchase from Burlington.com and SO well worth the price!|5
Very true to size. The coat is large enough to fit 2 sweaters under the coat. The coat looks good to wear. I recommend the coat to anyone. Thank you for having such a good product.|5
First time I ordered from Burlington. Great selection of colors and sizes.|5
I bought this as a gift for my cousin. She's about 85 pounds and 5 feet tall. The arms are a little long but she loves it. It's very soft and thick so it makes for a good winter coat without being too bulky.|5
Great value and beautiful style! My daughter loves it...|5
I purchased this for my 83 year old mother after much online searching. I liked the color and after receiving the item, was impressed with both the fabric and the fit of the garment on her. And best of all, she loved it!|5
I bought this as a gift for an older friend. She loves it. I love it too and I thought it was more for older people. But it complimented me.|5
The only downside is that when I reverse the faux fur to act as lining, the static electricity causes my sweater to pull up!!!!!! Do you have any solution to that?|5
I love this coat ITS BEAUTIFUL True to size and affordable|5
2 weeks ago I bought this jacket and the fit I'd very good. Loving all the pockets and the navy blue is a pleasing color.|5
This coat is not only very warm but also very stylish. Lots of compliments. Only drawback is hood is very roomy and flops down over your face! Size is exact and does not run big as some coats do so measure carefully. Very well made.|5
Bought this jacket for my daughter and it arrived within a week. She was so happy with it and the color is bright and pretty. This jacket is long so the cold doesn't blow up the back and the warm lining with extra elastic on the bottom helps that. Really, this jacket is well made and worth a lot more than I paid.|5
This is an affordable and warm ski jacket with a snow skirt/snow belt inside. This is super important because it stops the snow from entering the jacket. I am excited to use this for my upcoming ski trip.|5
I received it last week, just in time for the cold and windy weather. It's attractive and warm. I'm happy to have purchased it.|5
I purchased this two weeks ago . It came within a week. Really warm and I love it|5
I love this coat, my only regret is I didn't buy the black one too!!|5
Nice medium to lightweight coat, perfect for spring and fall. Fits well, true to size. I am typically a size 8 and a medium fits perfect.|4
I bought this jacket, because I was wanted a spring jacket. I am 22 and more on the petite side so when looking at the woman's jacket, I could already invision myslef drowning, ha. So I decided to take a look at the Junior jackets, and they looked perfect the sizing chart also helped a bunch. I got the jacket in a small and I still have room. It's a light jacket with a nice lining, so it keeps you warm but it's not overbearing, but it's also so fashionable. I have received ma y compliments and one of the girls said she likes it so much she wants one for herself. The color is an olive and different from those army green jackets I see everywhere, my favorite feature is the drawstring :) You should purchase this jacket you'll be glad you did.|5
The jacket was well made and I liked it very much. I had to return the jacket it was to small and was not warm enough for winter.|5
I bought this coat in Med. Petite because I'm in my third trimester and needed to buy a coat that was a size or two up so I can zip it over my expanding belly. I am 5'0" and I normally buy clothes in XS. Regular coats have sleeves that are too long or fall past my knees, but this one fits perfectly. It zips over my belly with enough room to grow, looks professional, and keeps me warm and dry. All in all, a good value.|5
Bought this for my daughter who wants a long zip coat with a snug fit. Feels warm and it's not heavy.|5

Right color of red and I love the way it fit. Thanks|5
This coat is nice and warm, the fur around the hood really keeps the wind and cold out. This particular garment tends to run small and I could have gone with a size bigger, which is something to keep in mind. The price was very reasonable and I am very glad I bought it.|5
Bought this coat a month ago, it is a beautiful coat, well made. It is a fitted style coat Great price for the coat. Would recommend.|5
purchased this jacket an gave it to my grand daughter, she loves it!|5
Bought it for my daughter for a spring jacket as well as part of her "Paddington" costume for Book day at school. She won first place for her costume and she loves the jacket and wears it daily now! Only drawback, jacket is navy blue and cotton, so it collects every white dog hair in our house..... lint roller takes care of that just fine, though.|5
I just brought this....last week.....got to get a longer trench next month|5
Super color, good quality, fits grate.I like my jacket a lot|5
This is a compliment-grabbing coat. I bought it in black. The fabric is conforming and wipe-able. The collar turns up in the inclement weather and it has a front zipper as well as snaps. The back has an elastic internal belt at the waist. The lining to the sleeves is a breathable fabric. There are elasticized cuffs with thumb holes. The local Ski-shop staff love the look and the fabric for spring skiing! There are small epaulets on the shoulder, with silver colored buttons and zips on the pockets. It is perfect for the cool weather currently in the Northeast. (Dec 2015). I'm a standard 10 and got a medium, it fits as I wanted, snugly.|5
This is a great fitting coat and feels comfortable with layers underneath as well. The hidden pockets are a great feature along with the tie belt that gives a slimming appearance. This coat is fully lined and it is the perfect weight. I like the length just above the knees.|5
I love the fit of this coat and it is so comfortable!! Love Love Love|5
Good quality ...true to size im 5'4 140lbs I got an medium and I could have got a small ..but I prefer extra space to layer...nicely insulated ....drawstring around waist are inside for a cleaner look ..overall really happy with what I got especially for the price nice winter coat and late fall in new york...I wore in mid 50s on a windy day nd felt no air go through nice and long pockets in right place 2 thumbs up|5
I bought this a couple of weeks ago. Very nice fabric|5
This coat is exactly what I was looking for; not too light-weight but warm and the fit is just right.|5
I bought this coat to replace one that I had that was similar, it's the right weight is not too heavy it's not too light I love the fit! The size was perfect the hood is a little loose like sort of open but I love it|5
I needed a coat to wear when dressed up in the wintertime. Because of an unusually mild winter, I've not yet needed it but am glad to have it for future wear.|5
I love this rain jacket! So cute and I can't wait to get to use it!|5
I bought this coat and I love the way it fits and feels. The color is nice too!|5
It's the best place to buy excelente stuff and Pay very cheap!|5
Great coat at a great price. Bought this for my mother. Loved it so much I bought one for my daughter and myself.|5
I bought and received this coat recently. It was too small. I returned it to the Burlington that is close to me. I ordered a larger one on the phone, and am very excited about receiving it.|5
Perfect for Spring, not too heavy not too light. Good material quality. Love this jacket for lighter days.|5
Perfect jacket! Excellent quality, looks sharp, and feels and wears awesome. Fit is right on. Excellent find and on sale was even better.
Love it.|5

I've been looking for a red coat and I found this one. It's nice and warm which is a great feature in New England. I don't like the extra phony pockets on the outside of the chest area, but I can live with them because the rest of the coat is wonderful. Nice and warm, stylish, looks great, feels great. Does run a bit small so I had to get the next size up but that's ok. Good value for the money. And it has a detachable hood. Another great feature.|5
True to the picture the quality surpass the expectation.|5
Great little jacket, fits perfect, soft leather,( I had wondered about that). Wasn't sure about the color it's not cream, or tan. Hard to describe but it's not bad.|5
I really like this jacket. It fits fine and it keeps me warm. I live in Maine and we have some pretty cold winters. I like the style of this jacket. It looks nice. It's a 3-in-1 jacket so it has a gray interior liner that you can wear by itself during the spring or early fall. The outer shell can be worn by itself as well. The outer shell will make a good raincoat as it's waterproof. You won't need to buy any other seasonal jackets because the components of this jacket can suit your needs during all seasons.|5
so pleased with this lovely warm coat...great to cuddle in when its frigid outside|5
Can't wait to wear it. Haven't worn it yet but when I do I will be warm.|5
I ordered this in a small and it fit perfectly with room bundle up even more. it is nice and heavy but not bulky. I love the Fleece lining! I will love the winters even more now!|5
Was really surprised that the coat was warm and beautiful|5
I got a great deal on this coat and I love it so much!|5
Love the coat well worth it fits great keeps me warm during cold weather|5
I love this jacket. It fits perfect! The quality and style was exact to order.|5
I bouth this jacket for my daughter and she loved nice and warm.|5
Bought for a Christmas gift, it was a big hit! Every girl there wanted one!!|5
my wife loves the coat. it made me feel good to see her smile.|5
I haven't had a chance to wear it yet as its Texas and still getting to 80 degrees here but I have been looking for a military style coat for a year and finally found a good one at a good price! Fits true to size, I ordered the medium and it's perfect. Good weight to the coat and I love all the detailing. So happy with this purchase.|5
I ordered it online and was happy when I got it because it fit perfectly. It keeps me warm and it has a hood in case it rains, an added bonus. I like that it has a zipper and I like the color.|5
This jacket feels amazing. It keeps me very warm, it's very good for the cold weather|5
I bought these Items about an month ago and everything fits perfect*********|5
Coat came just in time for our first cold spell. It was a perfect fit and very very warm!|5
I was happy to find this coat as a last minute purchase and for a great sale price. It has a pleasing fit with an attached non-removable belt for cinching which creates a nice definition so you don't look too bulky. It definitely keeps you warm with both a zipper and button up and the pockets were deep to keep hands covered above wrists, they also each have a button to keep closed when not in use. The inner mesh pocket was useful for carrying other items.|5
My only issues were with the hood which would slide off with or without wearing a knitted hat; it had no way of being tightened to stay in place when facing gusting winds. When it did stay on the faux fur would cover my eyes and become a nuisance but folding over this part helped somewhat. Even though it is a detachable zippered hood I left it on in hopes that it would serve its purpose even occasionally during wear.|5
Overall, it's a great jacket at a great value and I would purchase again if needed.|5
I ordered this for a ski trip to Denver. Though I haven't skied in it yet, I'm so pleased with the fit and the quality. I love the adjustable waist, and there are plenty of pockets. Hood is also removable. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a warm winter coat that's fashionable as well!|4
I bought my all weather jacket for Christmas. It was easy to order, great for the rain (totally dry) and I have not been cold in the snow! I even had a 2 day shipment. Thank you.|5
This is my new coat. It keeps me warm and it's the right height for me.|5
The only thing I wish is that it had a zipper that would zip up from the bottom for sitting in the car, it is also hard to zip, which is why I only gave four stars.|4
Looks nice. It appeared to be a- little more roomy than I expected. Overall I liked the length and the look of this coat|5
I'm new to Burlington Coat Factory. A friend sent me here. The coat is truly a warm welcome blessing.|5
It was better than I thought! I love the material. It is comfortable and simply elegant.|5
Beautiful Coat. Too big and you did not have a smaller size...|5
It was really great, I loved how many pockets it came with and also the suspenders on the inside to give added support. Over all great coat, just gotta wait to break it in once winter actually starts haha.|5
i bought this jacket for xmas i know he will lovw item this is my 2nd jacket from your co. i know he ll love itburlington have great products looking forward foing more business in the future.... karen|5
I bought this jacket as a much needed Christmas gift for my husband. He loves it! It's perfect for those cold drizzly days. Especially since the fur lining on the hood is detachable!|5
This jacket answers the need for warmth. It is stylish and has storage galore. The price was awsome and way lower then what it would cost in retail stores.|5
Got it for brother and dad for their fishing adventures. Quality is great! Warm and they loves it!|5
I bought 2 jackets in black for birthday presents and they loved them,|5
I brought my coat about a month ago and I am totally satisfied|5
This is a beautiful coat!!! I'm glad I picked the Tall version for my 6'3" boyfriend. It fits him perfectly except for the waistband, which is a little snug and is not elastic. However, he can still get it zipped and leather, even faux leather, tends to stretch out over time so I'm not worried. There were a few loose threads along the zipper upon arrival, but they were easily removed. It's really soft and very attractive, and hopefully will last a long time.|5
I love this Jacket! It's sad, that other department stores, don't offer amazing choices for Big & Tall. I will cherish this coat for years to come!|5
I bought this item a few weeks ago. I thoroughly enjoyed the jacket. Thank you for timely delivery, nice look and great fit.|5
I bought this for a Christmas present for my son and he loves it.|5
Am very happy with the online ordering process and love my coat|5
I bought it a week ago and it is warm, waterproof, and very flexible|5
We needed a sturdy, warm jacket for an active boy and kids coats were not lasting. This is a sturdy, well built jacket that should last the season.|5
Had this new jacket for about three weeks and very pleased with it and it looks sharp! I bought the blue with black accents.|5
I live the jacket it runs big but I like that since I dress in layers|5
I bought it for my son, he wasn't cold at all when he was standing out in the elements . He is 6'4 and the length of the jacket and arms were perfect|5
Just got it a few weeks ago. It's good and warm and flexible to remove the hood and fur and comfortable to wear. Worth the money.|5
My mom and I purchased this for my brother in AZ. He works outside in the evenings. He says that it is wonderful so far!|5
Bought 5 winter coats for my grandsons and was very happy with the fit and the design also the quality of all 5 coats.|5
I bought this coat as a gift and the person bought for loves it. It's full and warm so it has no need really for any extra layering or anything like that. They also said it's optional to wear a hat because the hood is so warm and full as well. Overall the coat was a great buy and the sizing is accurate and the color (ice) is beautiful!|5
This coat is great! Very warm, great for Winter and looks better in person than online.|5
Fit the boyfriend wonderfully and is still keeping him warm.|5
I bought this jacket for my husband and he loves it.|5
Purchased this jacket for my 11 year old son who is tall and slim in a large...fits him perfect and will last him for 2-3 more years...this coat was perfect in weight and look...this is his Sunday wear coat for cold mornings to church.|5
My son loves his new ski jacket he said it is so warm. Fits great.|5
I bought this as a gift and the receiver loved the jacket. The puffer style and the blue color look great and the light weight and warmth were perfect for the weather here.|5
Beautiful Jacket! Light, durable and stylish.
I bought my husband a new jacket to replace an old one he had for years.
He just loves it.|5
I very recently received it. Seems like a good quality jacket.|5
Jacket is light weight and well made. Just what I wanted.|5
Great Jacket! Would recommend this jacket to anyone.|5
I bought it for Christmas gift but I already give it to my husband he's so happy that.|5
Good quality love this product good style cam eon time|5
I bought this jacket for my nephew and he absolutely loved the look and fit of the jacket. The quality was great for the price! We were both very happy with the jacket and shipping was super fast! I will definitely buy again on line!|5
Bought this for Christmas for my grandson, he loves it. The fit was perfect. Perfect for my 15 year old who likes to layer, not bulky, but keeps him warm.|5
The jacket really blocks wind and keeps the cold out. I just wasn't crazy about the hood. It doesn't quite sit right on your head. The pockets are deep too|5
This is a very good coat for any kind of storm around east coast!|5
Very nice price. Runs a little big but you have to wear it in top of your clothes.|5
Not bulky but still warm. Fits true to size. Very nice look. Bought for a teenage boy who loved it|5
I bought this a month ago and so glad I did. Thanks|5
I got the jacket at a great price and it shipped quickly.|5
The lining is really nice to the skin, much warming than I thought on a winding day, and the arm length is what I needed.|5
The silk lining she likes
The color combo she loves
Durable zipper / snaps
Thick
Affordable|5
I bought this as a gift for my cousin. She's about 85 pounds and 5 feet tall. The arms are a little long but she loves it. It's very soft and thick so it makes for a good winter coat without being too bulky.|5
Great value and beautiful style! My daughter loves it...|5
I bought this jacket, because I was wanted a spring jacket. I am 22 and more on the petite side so when looking at the woman's jacket, I could already invision myslef drowning, ha. So I decided to take a look at the Junior jackets, and they looked perfect the sizing chart also helped a bunch. I got the jacket in a small and I still have room. It's a light jacket with a nice lining, so it keeps you warm but it's not overbearing, but it's also so fashionable. I have received ma y compliments and one of the girls said she likes it so much she wants one for herself. The color is an olive and different from those army green jackets I see everywhere, my favorite feature is the drawstring :) You should purchase this jacket you'll be glad you did.|5
Right color of red and I love the way it fit. Thanks|5
Bought it for my daughter for a spring jacket as well as part of her "Paddington" costume for Book day at school. She won first place for her costume and she loves the jacket and wears it daily now! Only drawback, jacket is navy blue and cotton, so it collects every white dog hair in our house..... lint roller takes care of that just fine, though.|5
I bought this a couple of weeks ago. Very nice fabric|5
This coat is nice and warm, the fur around the hood really keeps the wind and cold out. This particular garment tends to run small and I could have gone with a size bigger, which is something to keep in mind. The price was very reasonable and I am very glad I bought it.|5
purchased this jacket an gave it to my grand daughter, she loves it!|5
I got a great deal on this coat and I love it so much!|5
I bouth this jacket for my daughter and she loved nice and warm.|5

This jacket feels amazing. It keeps me very warm, it's very good for the cold weather|5
I bought these Items about an month ago and everything fits perfect*********|5
I needed a lightwright coat suitable for outside bus duty and my winter coat is too heavy now. This coat fits perfectly, is long enough for being covered in the rain, and has a hood. My daughter said she really liked it too! I bought it in Navy-size small. I wear a 6 in ladies and am 5' 5". At this price, I can get another!|5
Wasnt expecting it to fit me ..but it did! and it looks awesome! mine is Green-Military. Light not heavy. Good shipping and fast! Recommend it!|5
I ordered this jacket in black and I love it. It's very stylish and you can't beat the price. I ordered a small and it fits great.|5
Very well made and the length is good. Lots of pockets for when you're traveling. Runs small so order a size up.|5
This jacket is trendy and is a great length. The only thing is that the hood comes too far over the eyes when the hood is on, but other than that the jacket fits well and is light weight.|4
Love the fabric and design, too bad I didn't pay special attention to the Junior size, got a 2XL but still too small.|5
Purchased this jacket in black and its perfect for this Houston bipolar weather!!|5
It looks perfect on me. Whenever I wear it, people keep asking me where I got it|5
I thought that it would be too small since it was Jr. Plus. And I would've had to take it to the store for an exchange. But it fitted perfect. With a little more room to spare.|5
I brought this coat a month ago and I absolutely love it...I recommend anyone to purchase this coat|5
I purchased a size 2X online so I'd have enough room to wear sweaters or layers but coat fitted too large so I returned it to the store which was a smooth process hoping to get a smaller size but it wasn't available. However, the coat was nice looking and would of kept me warm.|4
This coat is super warm and lightweight. I'm glad I bought it. Fits perfectly. I'm a busty woman & I have no problems with zipping.|5
I wish that I would have purchased it in black too. This coat is super light and super warm. I LOVE the holes in the sleeve for my thumb.|5
I just got my jacket a week ago and I love the way it looks on me|5
I bought a coat about a month ago - good purchase.|4
Got the medium size and it just fits right. Im petite 5'0 $130lbs. Love the style especially the price. If you want room for thick shirt or sweater get the Large. I live in a state where its no cold all the time. So I only use light shirt underneath.|5
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it, but beware - it runs a little small.|4
This is a very nice looking jacket, I wish I could have fit in it. Very stylish|5
I just bought this tonight in store
omg so very warm|5
Purchased online and am very happy with the fit and look. I only wish I qualified for the free shipping.|4
I bought this for myself a couple of weeks ago. I love it, however it runs very small.|4
I brought this a few weeks ago it's warm and I liked the style of it.that shipping was great to with a few days I received my product love it..I got it at a reasonable price too|4
I bought this coat last week just before it got cold. Perfect to wear now, kept me warm and comfortable.|5
It's soo comfortable, and very warm. I received a lot of compliments about it|5
Bought the cost but I had to send it back to small.|3
Roomy and adjustable, this cute rain slicker is a must! The fit is true to size and has ability to cinch at the waist if you want a more form flattering silhouette. The only disappointments were the false top pockets and dummy zippers. The pockets below the waist are deep and can easily stash a large cellphone like the note 4 or 6 plus.|4
I ordered this a few weeks ago for a weekend getaway when I found out it might be rainy. It came within a few days, it fit perfectly (I just went by the size guide in the website, taking measurements) and is even more attractive in person. It was good for rainy and windy conditions. Great find for such a reasonable price!|5
I bought this jacket, but i wish the jackets top pockets were actual pockets|3
when this coat arrived, i was not impressed with it in the package, but once I put it on, I was so happy I bought it. it is all about the fit with this coat and it is very complimentary|5
Nice coat, shipped promptly but sadly was too small. Seemed to run a bit small.|3
I bought this jacket about a month ago! It has been pretty good so far.|4
Great size shape and color. Exactly what I needed and wanted|5
When buying this jacket, it does run super small, I usually wear a medium however I had to buy an extra large for this jacket to fit.|4
I purchase this coat for my daughter. She loves it, however, in my opinion a little on the thin side. The hood fits snug around the face.|4
I purchase this coat for my daughter. She loves it, however, in my opinion a little on the thin side. The hood fits snug around the face.|4
I bought them for my daughters and theye really love them|4
Warm, cozy, and very fashionable. Bought it for my niece and she loves it! Definitely going back to Burlington !|4
Only had it for a month but satisfied with the outcome.|5
I wish it was a little longer but overall great purchase!!!!!! The fur on the hood is very soft and fits well|5
This coat is ok, but they sewed the fur into the seam on the hood. I wear it sans hood.|3
I ordered this coat last month and it had 5 holes in it and day to day the holes got bigger and bigger the quality of this coat is so cheap it will keep you warm. Alittle but you will not survive and wett weather with thia coat i rate 0|1
I bought this coat two weeks ago for my daughter. I love the color. My daughter loves the coat. It fits her perfectly. I would certainly recommend it to others.|5
Good looking jacket but not quite warm enough even with a sweater underneath. Good for wearing in a car. The collar is warm but the zipper is not covered therefore it's annoying and cold. Also didn't like the strings hanging from the back of the jacket|3
I bought this about a couple of months ago and it fits my 15yr old daughter well!|3
Love the coat, fits perfectly, light weight and not bulky.|5
I saw this jacket in another store and could never find my size and was double the price! Looked on Burlington's website and I find it in my size for $25! I wore it to my works Christmas party and it was a hit!|5
I usually wear a "small" but ordered a "medium" and it was ridiculously small - like for a child. I was so disappointed.|1
When I selected this jacket was looking forward to it cause it has the hoodie come to find out is not women size was sad about it|1
It's a great buy for the quality and cost
I will purchase another one for my other daughter for Christmas mo NJ|5
I thought a Junior large I could wear but I actually need a XL even though bust said 38.5 inches. Loved the jacket probably have daughter try it on before I have to return it to the store. Love the color, the crop length. I usually wear a woman's large.|3
This coat was ok...I purchased the grey one for my daughter who has no problem wearing a Medium Junior size...so we went up to a size large hoping she might be able to wear it next year. This "coat" runs WAY SMALL! The sleeves were 2 inches too short and when she raised her arms the bottom of the coat showed her belly button, and there was no way she was gonna be able to cross her arms if bundled up. We've purchased several coats lately from Burlington and all of them seem to run very small. This will make 2 that I have had to return due to not fitting and it's really just not worth it, I won't be buying from here again. Also, this is more like a heavy jacket...hardly heavy enough to call a coat.|3
This coat runs very small! Now I have to return it!!!|1
I bought this in the size I usually buy that will cover a ladies suit or sweaters. It was so small that it wouldn't even close. It was not available 3 sizes larger or I would have rebought, It was a beautiful, soft coat.|1
I purchased this coat about 2 weeks ago and the coat has now began to show snags and it has busted on the side.I would like to be refunded my money or get anot her coat of my choice...|1
What a smart idea, that the hood comes off and the inside polar tech can be woren as a jacket. It's perfect for Arizona weather. From very cold to mild weather.|5
Item matched color and description. Runs a little small but I bought big so all is good!|5
I had been hunting for this very coat for weeks. It was a Christmas gift for my Girl fiends daughter and she was trilled with it.|5
Was very pleased with the quality and looks of the jacket.|5
This very cute Crop Denim Vest has just the right touch of decorative treatment! It can be paired with a wide variety of garments so you can get as creative as you want! Really like this one!|5
I bought this for my two year old and it fits perfectly. It appears like it will last at least another winter.|5
A gift for my grand-daughter. Her mom loved it & the price was really good!|5
Fit really nice. My daughter is 5 yrs but shes really skinny and wears 4. So this size 4 fit really good and was long enough for her. She play with the snow, ski and wear the jacket alone with no problem. Warm enough and the water never when thru her cloth. Love it. The hoodie didn't cover her entire head or stood on. But she's too hyper anyway. And i put her a beanie.|5
Purchased this and in less thank 2 weeks it arrived thank you|5
We got this coat for my daughter who is a fashionista and she loves it , mom can wear it when she outgrows it !!!|5
Bough as a gift and these are super cute and matched the coat perfectly.|5
Great quality and so cute! My 7 year old loves it!|5
My daughter was happy on her new vest. Got it for $10.99 clearance!|5
I bought this item around 3 weeks ago I'm to fall in love with it my baby looks beautiful with it|5
so i bought this jacket for my daughter. she smile and gave me call to let me know she was very happy with the jacket, she is 10|5
I bought this for my granddaughter and it's exactly what she wanted. When she wears it Christmas Day I hope she likes it.|4
This product was a great value and actually a better quality than what I thought it would be|5
My daughter was lacking a good functional winter coat. I searched online and found nothing with style and wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg. I finally rememembered burlington and I am so glad I did. For less than 15 dollars how could I pass this coat up. Its stylish and the lining inside is so warm! I was very impressed with the material inside and out. My little girl even got compliments from her friends moms and asked where we found it. Definitely a great buy!|5
Purchased for gift...very pleased.
Would purchase again.
.|4
I bought this for my grand daughter for Christmas. It's lighter weight than I thought it would be but it's still cute. I bought others for my older grand daughters on another site that were heavier and a better buy than this but they didn't have one in her size.|3
I'm again impressed by the quality of the material and the price was a bargain! My daughter has worn this every day since purchase, if though the weather has been very unusual for December.|4
Vivid red and so cute on... worn to a formal Christmas occasion and received a lot of compliments|5
A very cute coat. It fits my little girl perfectly. The only thing was that it came with a hat instead of a scarf. I ordered the coat in purple. The picture shows the coat in pink with the hat. I bought the coat with the description as saying it came with a scarf. No complaints really...I just thought the writers should know.|5
The coat is cute and fits my daughter well. This did not actually come with a scarf though...only a hat. The hat is cute but I wish the scarf was actually included.|3
Great product and price. I will recommend to friends.|4
It really warm but a bit smaller than I expected. It very nice for it price|4
My daughter really wanted a coat that was a little longer. This one was perfect. It hasn't been super cold yet, but so far she's been warm at the bus stop in the morning.|4
My girl really like it this jacket it's very cute!!!|4
Too small. Not true to size. Will not fit her for only a month or so.|1
Bought it for my son for a trip to Utah in the snow. He was warm and dry the whole time! Well worth it!|5
Bought this jacket a few weeks ago for my 9 year old son. Bought a size large, it's a little too big but any added layering and it's perfect. Also will fit perfect for the new fall/winter this year! Great deal, gear buy!|5
I bought this for next Christmas for my grandson, so it's not been worn yet. It looks and feels like it will definitely keep him warm. I like the style, the choice of colors, and especially the price offered here.|5
I bought the double jacket to replace a similar one my son had for 2 years n grew out off. When he put it on one 32 degree day, said wow really warm, n loved it. Best Buy and very versatile.|5
Great Coat; the 3-1 feature allows him an option to wear the coat and the vest or just the vest with a hoodie|5
I was trying to find a good quality coat for my son in the burlington store but there was only two left that he couldn't fit, so I went to the site and it has more of a selection. Glad I ordered online. I would Definately recommend this coat!|5

Somehow we lost it and thankfully I found it here, reordered it right away street a long day of online searching. This jacket was the best jacket I got my son I had to get him another one. If you want your little one to stay warm search no further.|5
Picked up this Jacket for my grandson. Was pleasantly surprised when I seen that the lining was warm and extremely soft.|5

My kids loved these fleece hoody's. They tell me they r warm but not baulky and uncomfy.|4
Excellent buy! It looks great and the quality is excellent. Very happy with purchase.|5
This is a wonderful purchase, great quality! Material is perfect!|5
I bought this for my son. Jacket is much better looking than the pic shows. Seems warm and looks nice. The only issue is that I came to me with a hole in the collar and none of the stores have a replacement and they are out of the correct size online. I have waited three weeks and they haven't gotten any more in stock.|4
I got this jacket for my son when we had the sudden change in the Texas weather it was a perfect fit and it met all expectations! !|5

Just brought the coat for my nine year old, and he loves it.|4
I bought this jacket because it looked very warm and heavy enough to block any wind or cold. I was correct my son is nestled in and it is very durable|4
I purchased this coat about 2 weeks ago, and when boy tried it on, he loved it!!! mostly because of the vest included.|4
I thought this coat had more installation. It was too light for very cold temperatures. Good for mild cold days.|3
I bought this coat in hopes it'll last my sons a couple years. When my son wore it once the zipper would go up but unzip while the zipper was up. I'm very unsatisfied with your product!|2
I purchased the coat a week ago. I love it. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my baby girl but it's too nice to wait until then. I'm not a pink and purple kind of girl. Online it looked kind of ugly. When I got it, I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. I am very pleased with the heaviness of the coat and the look is gorgeous. We live in Chicago and I always buy my kids coats from Burlington. This is my baby girls first winter and she's going to be nice a d warm in her very first winter coat.|5
Perfect Christmas presents. They arrived right on time. Definitely will do it again!|5
Purchased this and in less thank 2 weeks it arrived thank you|5
I liked the jacket, I thought that it had a zipper but the only thing that I don't like is that the button will not stay button and there is no zipper.|5
The coat was much nicer than I expected. The fabric was nice and soft, just right for a little girl. My granddaughter looked so cute for Easter!|5
I bought this item around 3 weeks ago I'm to fall in love with it my baby looks beautiful with it|5
Very well made and great for Fall weather and chilly days|4

great jacket. I love the style of the jacket with the hood|5
Good quality and fine workmanship. I especially liked the flap of material covering the top of the zipper so it won't pinch the baby's neck when it's closed. Very pleased with the value for a very good price. I would recommend this jacket.|5
These are good for everyday wear and for sports. My girls love them!|5
Too many plain panties in pacjage. I would have liked all panties to have image|5
These bras are beautiful and look great on my young granddaughters|5
Great for young girls just starting to wear intimates|5
Looks great in my little girl's hair and she loves the colors|5
I brought this for my grand daughter for Christmas, I'm sure she will Love it.|5
Bought it for my 9 year old daughter, she love it. She loved how it folds and goes right into her purse. There's plenty of makeup.|5
I was going to give it to my daughter but I ended up keeping myself. the style reminded me of my old backpack as a kid. It has a lot of room for a weekend get away.|5
These socks are super warm my little girl hates to take them off.|5
Granddaughter loves it. Beautiful just as described|4

My daughter has been begging for silver high tops and I found these online for so cheap! She loves them so much that she doesn't want to ever get a scratch on them!|5
My daughter loves that hoodie. She fell in love with it the moment she seen it.|5
I thought the fabric, colors and style are perfect for Spring into Summertime weather!
My Grandbaby Girl loves this top!|4
I put these on and after one mile of walking they started rippling apart. They are one size bigger than what I wear so it wasn't because the were too small, these are the worst leggings I have ever purchased.|1
This was the best find ever for my daughter. She goes to a private school and needed a rolling backpack for the upcoming school year. I love the everyday prices along with the quality that your getting for your money. They always have great customer service in the stores and very easy experience online. I love Burlington and always find bargains for my family without hurting the bank. Keep it up!|5
I bought this for a cruise that requires an airline flight as well. Has plenty of room, light weight and easily handled by a 3 yr old.|5
Exactly what I wanted. Good quality. Granddaughter will love it.|5

Its pretty cool i cant wait till we go on vacation|5

I bought this suitcase for my 4 year old son and he loved it. It's small enough he can carry it himself but large enough to carry a couple suits of clothes and his toys.|5
The luggage was delivered 2 days early and in good condition. The luggage passed with flying colors. Very durable I love it.|5
Bought this for my grandson for a Christmas gift. They are going to Disney in January, It should be great for him!|5
Colors are beautiful and it's a great size for children. We bought it for my 8 year old nephew and he loves it.|5
I bought a small lugagge for my kid. It was an execellent deal!|5
My nephew loved the suitcase, but Burlington needs to do a better job in the packing department. It had a few scratches on the back part of the case. Unfortunately, I opened the box with my nephew and he didn't care about the scratches like I did.|4

I hate when I order an Item and it doesn't look like the picture.
I was worried about that since they offer two designs but it was exactly as shown.
My only critique is the handle should be sturdier considering little children will be pulling at it all the time. My nephew was exciting, thus pulled it around everywhere he went for literally 2 days until I hid it. The handle is kinda shakey now. But overall nice item|5
Bought this for grand daughter 2 1/2 for Christmas, can't wait to give it to her. They are going to Disney in January - she will be so excited to have her own luggage!|5
This Ninja Turtle suitcase was all my 6 year old asked Santa for. He loves it! It came well packaged but there were still some scratches on the top of it. I wanted to try and sneakily send it back for a replacement , but like I said, he loves it. Other than the scratches, which was more of a store issue, the product is sturdy and colorful and pretty spacious.|4
Such a cute roll-on for little ones, great colors and rolls easily. It seems to be a good value but it hasn't been used yet as it's a holiday gift for my 2 yr. old grandbaby|4
The Minnie Mouse Hardside Luggage shipped in the two day period it said it would.
I love it and my granddaughter will love it too!|5
The handle was broken--not so good for a suitcase for anyone, but particularly bad for a three year old who needs to pull it.|1
it's perfect for a short time, my son 4 years old, love it, but it's not durable and poor quality|3

Bought for my 6 year old who will only wear leggings and she loves them.|5
I bought these jeans for my girls early back to school shopping. They are made of a good quality denim and the lace detail is beautiful. These jeans can be paired with a dressy top or a more casual top.|5
This is a nice jean to wear dressy or casual. The detailing on the pockets and around the waist is a nice touch especially for tween girls.|5
Wish they had adjustable waist for children pants or in between sizes|2
What a smart idea, that the hood comes off and the inside polar tech can be woren as a jacket. It's perfect for Arizona weather. From very cold to mild weather.|5
Item matched color and description. Runs a little small but I bought big so all is good!|5
I had been hunting for this very coat for weeks. It was a Christmas gift for my Girl fiends daughter and she was trilled with it.|5
Was very pleased with the quality and looks of the jacket.|5
This very cute Crop Denim Vest has just the right touch of decorative treatment! It can be paired with a wide variety of garments so you can get as creative as you want! Really like this one!|5
I bought this for my two year old and it fits perfectly. It appears like it will last at least another winter.|5
A gift for my grand-daughter. Her mom loved it & the price was really good!|5
Fit really nice. My daughter is 5 yrs but shes really skinny and wears 4. So this size 4 fit really good and was long enough for her. She play with the snow, ski and wear the jacket alone with no problem. Warm enough and the water never when thru her cloth. Love it. The hoodie didn't cover her entire head or stood on. But she's too hyper anyway. And i put her a beanie.|5
Purchased this and in less thank 2 weeks it arrived thank you|5
We got this coat for my daughter who is a fashionista and she loves it , mom can wear it when she outgrows it !!!|5
Bough as a gift and these are super cute and matched the coat perfectly.|5

I bought this for my granddaughter and it's exactly what she wanted. When she wears it Christmas Day I hope she likes it.|4
This product was a great value and actually a better quality than what I thought it would be|5
My daughter was lacking a good functional winter coat. I searched online and found nothing with style and wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg. I finally rememembered burlington and I am so glad I did. For less than 15 dollars how could I pass this coat up. Its stylish and the lining inside is so warm! I was very impressed with the material inside and out. My little girl even got compliments from her friends moms and asked where we found it. Definitely a great buy!|5
Purchased for gift...very pleased.
Would purchase again.
.|4
I bought this for my grand daughter for Christmas. It's lighter weight than I thought it would be but it's still cute. I bought others for my older grand daughters on another site that were heavier and a better buy than this but they didn't have one in her size.|3
I'm again impressed by the quality of the material and the price was a bargain! My daughter has worn this every day since purchase, if though the weather has been very unusual for December.|4
Vivid red and so cute on... worn to a formal Christmas occasion and received a lot of compliments|5
A very cute coat. It fits my little girl perfectly. The only thing was that it came with a hat instead of a scarf. I ordered the coat in purple. The picture shows the coat in pink with the hat. I bought the coat with the description as saying it came with a scarf. No complaints really...I just thought the writers should know.|5
The coat is cute and fits my daughter well. This did not actually come with a scarf though...only a hat. The hat is cute but I wish the scarf was actually included.|3
Great product and price. I will recommend to friends.|4
It really warm but a bit smaller than I expected. It very nice for it price|4
My daughter really wanted a coat that was a little longer. This one was perfect. It hasn't been super cold yet, but so far she's been warm at the bus stop in the morning.|4
My girl really like it this jacket it's very cute!!!|4
Too small. Not true to size. Will not fit her for only a month or so.|1
This Communion dress is beautiful and so well constructed. The attention to detail is wonderful.|5
I bought this dress to match the bridesmaids dresses in my daughter's wedding! The color is exactly what is shown on the site. However the shiny belt on the front and the shiny skirt of the dress are so much prettier than in the picture! The back has a beautiful big bow that ties. This dress is very pretty and the price is wonderful!|5
I love the color of the dress. Looks just like the picture on the website.|5
Bought this for my 10 yr.old grandaughter. It is well made. She loved the necklace that came with it..I thought the picture on the website was pretty, but it actually is cuter when you see it.In the pic the little sequins look silver, but their coral like the top of the dress..very cute.|5
This is a beautiful, good quality and totally affordable piece. I love it!|5

This dress was even more beautiful in person than on the website.
It sparkles beautifully and moves beautifully when my daughter walks.|5
I bought this 4T dress for Easter. My 3 year old slid right into. It fit perfect! very well made. The inside has a slip. Which makes this dress that much more comfortable. I purchased a hat and shiny black Mary Janes to match with this pretty dress. Now if my daughter would let me put it away. She loves it.|5

I bought this dress to use as a flower girl dress. The color matches perfectly with the bride maids dress.

Size was right on, the only thing is it was a tad shorter than expected and my girl isn't tall at all. Very pretty.|4
I bought this as an Easter dress for my 5 yr old grandaughter who wears a size 6. However, I was very dissapointed, as she was, that the dress is too big. She picked it out and loved it, but, she may not be able to wear it for another year or so.|4
I bought these for our granddaughters for Easter. They look adorable. The size was spot on. The first time they put them on, there was glitter everywhere. But I dried them in the dryer on air fluff and got all the rest of the loose glitter off.|4
I purchased this as a birthday present for my granddaughter's birthday next month. I really like them they are so cute.|5
Bought these for my 14 year granddaughter for Christmas. She loves them. They are not real heavy jeans, but thicker than leggings. They stretch and fit her beautifully. The size and length are perfect. Bought a 16. If you are really tall they would be short. She is about 5'4 and they are long enough to touch the floor. They have been washed and barely shrunk. So glad I picked these|5
I BOUGHT SEVERAL PAIR FOR MY DAUGHTER, AND SHE LOVES THEM!!!|5
Nice change of pace from leggings and these worked!|5
Hard to find little peeps embroidered jeans. When you are little and your sister is older you want to dress like them. These are so tough and keep their color.|5
My niece is 8 and she cannot stand actual jeans as much as I have tried to buy them for her she just won't wear them. I bought her one pair of these when I was in the store and she ended up loving them! I went online to buy her more because I don't live around a BCF and they had other styles. Can't wait until she gets them Christmas. She'll love all the pairs.|5

My daughter has been begging for silver high tops and I found these online for so cheap! She loves them so much that she doesn't want to ever get a scratch on them!|5

These socks are super warm my little girl hates to take them off.|5
Omg I love This so much!!! I wore this one time and it was complemented so much cos of the color and style|5
Bought this in both colors available for my daughter's birthday. She just turned 8, bought a size 10 because she doesn't like swimsuits to fit too tight. They fit her perfect and she loves them both. The skirt seems to slip when she is running around, but probably because it technically is a size too big for her.|5
my daughter loves Minnie and she can't wait to wear this once summer gets here! The fit is great and the suit is really cute!|5
This very cute Crop Denim Vest has just the right touch of decorative treatment! It can be paired with a wide variety of garments so you can get as creative as you want! Really like this one!|5

Purchased it for my daughter beautiful color, my daughter loves it.|4
Bought 2 shirst for my granddaughters one is a size 4t and the othet is a reg size 5, but I purchased a reg size 4 & size 6 both where to small had to give the size 6 to the size 4t child. But shirts are very pretty|3
Item was very pretty but smaller than appeared in photo. Too short. The main reason I bought it was because the length was several inches below the waist. Not so. Very disappointed. I will be returning it.|2

Love it the price is great better than other stores|5
I bought this bag for my aunt as a thank you gift and it is more that what I expected, very sturdy and will be ordering one for myself.|5

I'm so happy with this purchase beautiful ring!! Love it, true to size!|5
I love the length, not to long, not too short.....|5

I bought these earrings for my daughter and they are beautiful!. They are bigger than I expected but nonetheless, very beautiful. Now I need a pair for me :)|5
Exceeded my expectations, simply glamorous bling, bling|5
Absolutely beautiful and comfortable to wear. Love it|5
I purchased these online for my wife, they were very attractive and large hoops as stated , but no where on the pieces was there a sterling silver stamping which gives rise to the possibility that they are not,... unless you see them in the store or absolutely verified as Sterling Silver in the future , I would ask questions.|3
Ring could have at least been in a box or something instead of taped plastic|3
2 pair were the same color, 1 pair was a different color. I have 3 holes in each ear, so it looks funny wearing them all together|3
This item is an exceptional value. However, I cannot wear the hoops; they are way too big.|2
Great price, attractive piece, authentic coin,cool..|4
I purchased this curling iron for myself for Christmas. It was wrapped and under the tree, but I was so excited to try it, I opened it before Christmas. It was a total disappointment. It's very, very hard to use. I'm not a beautician, but I've been curling/styling my hair all my life. I KNOW how to use a curling iron. OH, it did curl my hair. Unfortunately, the curl was wonky, curled the wrong direction and with funky marks on my hair. Also, I did slightly burn my finger once and the palm of my hand as well. No major burns thank goodness. I was also thinking of purchasing this form my 13 year old grand-daughter. I won't after my personal experience with it. I'll be shipping this back very soon.|1
it was a gift. the person did give me feedback. I 'm like, I have wanted to have one like this|3
light enough for summer wear. Works well over braided hair|4

Wallet is exactly as pictured. If it's the style you're looking for, you will be happy with it.|5

I bought this for my son as a stocking stuffer, he had been growing a beard since the first of November. Well he went into the bathroom to try it out and shaved nearly all of his face off. He loved the product so much he couldn't stop with the trimming. He looks good with what he has now not the bear he had became.|5
These worked out great! Just what was needed and they will be used. Easier to iron than 100 percent cotton. Should have bought another packet. Arrived in time for the birthday and great quality.|5
This purchase was a Christmas gift for my son. He said he didn't want a bulky scarf and this set was perfect.|5
I bought this an month ago and my lover was happy, thank you for the on time shipping|5
Satisfied w/products size, value, color & apperances|4
Nice quality and good value. Would highly recommend|4
The socks are terrific and fit perfectly. I'm glad I purchased two packs. The multiple colors go well with different colored outfits. Less sweaty feet while exercising.|5
My daughter and i both love it. The sz is great with braids and warm enough for the cold too. It has become her college staple head gear. Got it in grey went back for the brown and there was no more :-). heart broken|5
I needed a new hat. I love it. The button sits it off.|5
I love it. Can't wait to wear it. Going to buy one for my sister|5
light enough for summer wear. Works well over braided hair|4
I have been buying these for years! The fit is great and they are comfortable. The control top holds your tummy in makes you look thinner. My favorite color is the Misty Taupe. I highly recommend these panty hose to you are long lasting and very durable. I wash them in the washer and hang them up to dry. Great price too!|5
I love these pantyhose--attractive, yet supportive. They massage your legs all day and look great! The problem is their poor availability--both online and in the stores. When they do arrive in the stores, they are immediately hoarded. especially in the Wild Rice color. When they are featured online, there is very poor selection, especially in the same color. Typically only one or two pairs in white are available. Unfortunately, I am a teacher who needs to stand all day, not a nurse!|5
I have been wearing this brand of hosiery for about 20 years and it is the best on the market. I get worried when I go to the store and not find them in stock! Please stock more of these in all of your stores as I travel a lot and stop at all of the Burlington stores. Thanks.|5
I have been buying Burlington Control Top Pantyhose for most of my life. They last longer than any other pantyhose on the market. Please don't stop making this product. They are Great!|5
I have been buying these hose for 25 years and just found out that they are being discontinued. I quickly ran around Memphis the other day 3 stores all being between 25 and 35 miles from my house. I bought what was left in myour size. 17 pairs in all. I really wish that they do not discontinue them. They outlast all other brands.|5
I love these! Only ones I have bought for the last 33 years! Whenever I can find them, I admit---I buy all they have in my size in the Black, Off Black, and Misty Taupe! Great quality, great price, great value. I hope they never discontinue them. I only wish I could find them in the stores more frequently.|5
This is better than shopping in the store!!! - They are always out of my size and the color. I love this color - no other brand has anything this close and its durable - I get several wears out of 1 pair.|5
I buy 10 pair every time I go to the store. I am ordering some one line today to save a trip. They look good and really last I am tall and plus size, so it is hard to find hose that fit well.
Thank you|5
This is the most soft and luxurious blanket! It melts like butter when you surround yourself with it. It keeps you warm and feels so good against your skin. Wonderful blanket!|5
Bought this for ourselves and are really pleased with it. Enough so, that we wouldn't hesitate to buy one as a gift. Soft, warm, and cuddly.|5
This throw is gorgeous!!! Deep, rich colors and so,so soft. The sale price was fantastic. Highly recommend.|5
Purched 2 twin Velvet Plush blankets to use as bedspreads in my guest room.
Very vibrant color, snuggly soft, much better than I expected for the price.
Was able to find same color window coverings in store. My room has a bright, happy look.|5
Great deal. Worth the buy. Looks just like the picture|5
This throw is gorgeous!!! Deep, rich colors and so,so soft. The sale price was fantastic. Highly recommend.|5
I was looking for something coral to give me that pop of color and these beautiful pillow did it. They are great quality and are nice and fluffy!|4
I bought this blanket a couple weeks ago and washed it 3 times and black fuzz balls are still falling off of it and going everywhere. I have black fuzz over all my clothes. This blanket is horrible quality.|1
Feel very pleased with this item! Now that winter is here, I feel very happy to buy it. A very good item. Love it.|5
Soft, warm, and cuddly. Would definitely purchase again for myself or as a gift.|5
Bought this as a baby blanket...bad idea. This blanket sheds, sheds, sheds...it's been washed twice and still producing tons of lint in the dryer. Hoping it stops b/c it is beautiful and soft as silk and I'd love to be able to use it!|3
I ordered this online and when it arrived, the Doc McStuffins character was already peeling off bag. I will be returning it to the store!|1
I purchased these curtains (in steel blue) today to match an existing bedroom comforter. It matches perfectly and adds just enough color to the room. They provide some shading while allow in some sunlight to shine through. The color on the package is the true color of the curtains. Great buy.|5
Exactly what I wanted, looks great in my bathroom. Love the variety of curtains online and in the store. Very impressive. S&H was a little much though.|5
I bought these panels for my living room and they look fantastic. The price was right, they were delivered on time and they look great!|5
I bought these gorgeous curtains about a month ago. They are great, light comes through nicely. They are not that wide but they are perfect for my windows.|5

Beautiful black window panel with grey flowered design makes it more pretty|5
Thgese curtains are beautiful and look great at my windows.|5
I truly thank Burlington.com for having every color in sheers that i was looking for my rooms looks good and i will be ordering more soon i have told my family in Memphis,Tn thanks again.....|5
I saw these curtains and I knew I had to purchase them! I am very pleased with my order|5
These are so much better than I expected....ordered 11 pairs...Very classy looking ...well pleased.|5
The curtains were not as dark yellow as in the picture but they still worked out great.|4
Bought all they had at store and then needed two more, so glad for online site.|5
I needed new bedroom curtains to"lighten up" my look.I wanted a nice light weight curtain with a bit of a design.I also wanted a grommet top.I couldn't find the right look for the right price anywhere so I thought I'd give Burlington online a shot.These curtains are perfect! They were a little narrower than some I'd seen so I just got extra.Love them.|4
They are nice panels, at a great price. But they are not black out though they do keep the cold out nicely. My window is 102 inches wide. I used 3 sets. I have another set to add that might make it better. Other black out sets i have had are entirely blackout, without having to buy extra sets so they bunch up and the fabric overlaps to make a blackout.|4
I had previously purchase the same curtain for 1 window..had been to 2 burlingtons looking for the same color... an off white / ivory. Never found it so decide to take a chance an order online..the curtain I received is a tan color. Cant have one window w white & one window w tan . Will be returning|2
I ordered 2 panels as that was all there was, could have used 4, but it works.|3
I return the curtains looked nothing like the picture. This company needs to have better product detail and a zoom in view of product.|1
Arrived in a timely manner. Looks great. Looks great in the apartment along with the other planter purchased.|5
Arrived in a timely manner. Looks great in the apartment. Well made.|5
I love the way this little stands look in front of my patio door. The plants help bridge the view from outside to inside.|5

We normally don't review items but we were so impressed with this dresser that we had to share!
We purchased this dresser for our nursery. The first one came in the mail and as we took it out of the box we noticed a few pieces were broken, so we returned it to the store and re-ordered. So glad we did! The second one came and it was perfect. The color online is very close to the actual color. The size is PERFECT for the nursery. It has a slight sheen to the finish but doesn't look cheap. It took my husband less than 30 minutes to assemble and he only needed a screwdriver to attach the knobs/handles. We haven't put it to use yet but as of now we couldn't be happier with this purchase.|5
We bought this dresser for a changing table/dresser for our new grandson. Honestly the box sat in your foyer for at least a week , putting off putting it together. When we tackled it, it was so easy to put together and was a sturdy, beautiful dresser!|5
Shipping was fast and it only took my husband 30 minutes to put together! Super easy assembly! Looks nice and appears pretty sturdy. Roomy drawers and nice, different color. Can't wait to put the matching crib together to see the pieces together.|5

I was looking for this toy box on line and found that Burlington had the best deal. Before this I wouldn't have thought to look at Burlington. It also arrived in a few days, good shipping. I like that the toy box has small drawers on the bottom. Just right for Legos.|5
It holds a lot of toys and is very sturdy. It fits nicely in our living room.|5
Love it!!! Very spacious for lots of toys (large and small) and I like the bottom bins for the little toys. Happy that they are just under it and not attached it makes it easier for the kids to put away. Used by two rambunctious two year old boys.|5
This is my 15 month old's first toddler bed. It was easy to assemble and was in great condition and looked just like the online images. She absolutely loves her big girl bed. This is the only reasonably priced toddler bed that was high quality and in the natural wood color that we liked. I would purchase it again 100x over.|5
It looks more expensive than it is. Very fashionable and clean. The assemble took sometime and was NOT clear enough (I had to disassemble a few parts because the images were not clear). Also, I must say that it doesn't see like it has the best back support but with a great mattress at this age it should be fine.|5

This bookshelf is very well made and just beautiful. It looks hand-picked and hand-carved. For the price it is a great deal. The shelves are wide and strong. The drawer below is a nice feature. The only thing I wish the drawer had were tracks because it just goes in the slot with no tracks.|5
It doesn't take up to much room. I'm very pleased with this|5

Everything about the chair we purchased met or exceeded our expectations. It has the appearance of regular furniture but sized for a child. Our granddaughter loves it.|5
A great buy. I bought one for my son in store and 2 more this Christmas for my nephews. They love it. It is the perfect size for a toddler. I just wish they had more color options|5
I bought this 2 weeks ago, love them. Everyone compliments me on them|5
I bought this about a month ago and I've received so many compliments on it. I recommend this 100%.|5
It was shipped on time and I love the beds for my girls|5
We bought this dresser for our baby room..It was a great desision|5
Nice and sleek. Coordinates with my real leather furniture.|5
We bought these for our children for Christmas and the one was busted and the other wont recline. I was looking to exchange them and they are now out of stock.|1
Very nicely made & good strong quality product. My kids really liked it & easy to clean|5
Great Quality. Just imagine adult furniture shrunk down to kid size. Adorable!!|5
I bought this for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday...she loves it and I love it....very sturdy and made so well....so beautiful.....very happy with this purchase....|5
My granddaughter lovesi t. She watches TV. on it and just sits on the chair. It is everything I was expecting.|5
I ordered this for my granddaughter to put in my parents house so she would have her "own chair". We all love it so much that I ordered another one for my house.|5
I bought this chair for my son and he absolutely loves it! This is a great chair for a great price!!|5
I purchased the rocking chairs for Christmas presents for my twin grandsons because they are low to the floor and I had bought one years ago for my other grandson and he loved it and used it everyday up to until he turned 6. I hope they get as much use out of them also.|5
My son loves this bed - it's great quality and very sturdy. Looks great in his room|5
It's the perfect size and seems to be very well made|5
It's the perfect size and seems to be very well made|5
I purchased this desk for my 10 year old grandson because of the bookcase feature and it was a great solution for his smallish bedroom. The desk fits him perfectly and the bookcase holds the books he is interested in now. It won't accommodate every book he owns but it is adequate for what he is reading now and has read recently. It was easy to assemble and seems to be sturdy. Excellent choice for his room.|5
I love this table and chair set in my daughter's room, it is so lovely in white and seems really strong. It's a great size, not too big and not too small. She is almost 2 and loves to sit and color and have tea parties on it and I expect it will last well for many years.|5
Bought about a week ago still standing strong. Daughter loves it.|5
Love this vanity - doesn't take too much room - perfect for a child - easy to assemble - sturdy good quality wood - recommend this vanity...|5
Having this changing table has been such a relief on my back! And it matches our Dream On Me folding crib beautifully, too.|5
We cannot believe the quality.
It is heavy so the stools do not tip and the table is large and feels much more expensive than it was. Colors are bright and fun. There is truly no other set like this one.
I love this company called LOLLY&ME.....They seem to really get design and value.|5
I was very pleased with the chair that I purchased! The price was right and the chair was more then what I expected! It just right for the little children. Thank you! I hope to purchase another one in the near future.|5
It shipped quickly and it was exactly what I was looking for. You can't beat the price and I'm so excited to give it to my 1 year old for Christmas. It's the perfect size.|5
This was better quality than I thought it would be for the money granddaughter loved it|5
Darling fabric--pink gingham--seems sturdy, wood legs, good sise for a 1-3 yr old. Only thing that should be different is to have a sturdy backing underneath the fabric in the back-- could puncture easily through fabric.|4
I bought this chair upholstered in denim for my 18 mo old daughter for Christmas. I am very impressed with the quality if material. The denim is a heavy weight dark indigo. It reads more modern and less country (which we like.) The upholstery is tight. No wrinkles. The foam is firm and smooth. The construction is sturdy. The price is a bonus too! The best value around!|4
I bought this chair for my Grandson for Christmas. I could not believe the quality of this chair for the price I paid. It is very well built, looks like I paid much more for it and my Grandson loves it!|5
This chair is everything it says it is. Very nice construction - material is nice and taut on the chair. Can't wait to give it to my nephew for Christmas - he will love it.|5
Love this chair. Very sturdy. My 2 year old loves to kick back in it|5
Super cute and great construction!!! Can't wait to give it to my granddaughter!!!|5
It really looks pretty cheaply made and there are several flaws|3
This sofa is great, so comfy, cute, affordable my daughter loves it!|5
I Bought this for my 1 year old grandson for Christmas. It is adorable. I know he will love it.|5
I was looking for a small chest of drawers with open space below, and this piece fits the bill perfectly! Easy to assemble (just screw in legs and base), attractive (buttermilk off-white color with nice dark hardware), and low profile (13" deep). Good value for the money!|5
This is a nice table. Quality material, not cheap particle board. Easy to put together, just screw the legs and bottom shelf on. The drawers stick a bit and it's a little wobbly but overall it's a good piece. I had my eye on this piece at other stores, but Burlington had the best price. Shipping was fine, came on time with no damage. I'd recommend this product if you're considering it.|4
we got the bed in great time,it was a gift for our grandson,he loved it! we are absolutely pleased in the overall experience with shopping online with burlington coat factory!!!|5
Easy to put together, took me about 30 mins to do so. My little one loves it. I have even later on it a few times to put her to sleep and is sturdy.|5
Nice Bed fairly easy to put together but had a problem with some of the screws not fitting so far it's been no problem|4
I bought this toddler bed 2 weeks ago and was so happy with it! I couldn't believe the amazing quality and style.|5
took no time to get to me, easy to put together and once i did, my 1 y/o loved it!|4
I was disappointed in the quality of the bed. It's doesn't seem too sturdy. But for a little one around 26 pounds, it will be fine. The bed itself also had some scratches and wood pealing off. But the damage was on the back side of the bed, so we will always keep that part against the wall.|3

This was my second Pkolino chair purchase. It was bought for one of my grandson's first birthday. He already loves sitting in it. (His almost three year old brother loves his own Pkolino chair). Well constructed and better quality than many of the cartoon type character chairs out in the market. Fabric seems pretty durable. And all this is at a reasonable price. I highly recommend it. Several people asked at the birthday party, "where can I get one?"|5
The design, color, and quality of this chair is great, but the description says it won't topple over which is not true. I have to hold the chair in place when my son goes to sit in it. It's so light that it moves when he moves in it, and if he reaches for something the chair goes with him. I'm anticipating a fall one day.|4
It is smaller than expected but otherwise very nice|4

The denim does rub off onto the wall and it's not really stain resistant like description says. So we will just scotch guard them and keep them away from wall when in use. Very cute and sturdy frame and my boys 2 & 4 love them|4
It gets dirty pretty fast but my daughter now enjoys getting in and out of it.|5
Christmas present for our Grandaughter....Loved it!|4
I bought this bed to make more space in my guest room/office. I ordered on Monday and bed arrived on Fri. Assembly instructions were clear. It wasn't too bad to put together although it took a bit of finagling to get the slats to stay in the back of the frame while the sides were connected to the back. I managed to do it alone in 2 hours. The color is warm (not as dark as suggested in online photos) and the wood grain quite nice. Burlington had the best price I could find online. I am happy with the purchase.|4
It was delivered on Saturday, was easy to put together, and I'm pleased with the results.|4
I recently purchased this espresso colored daybed. It is beyond my satisfaction. The reviews were very positive so I decided to purchase the bed. It was easy to put together and it looks amazing. Definite one to not fear purchasing.|5
This is a very nice piece of furniture. It does take a bit of time to put together, but for the price it's worth it compared to what you've pay for pre-assembled furniture. The color is as dark as the picture shows, very very deep brown, in case you want to match a crib to the color. The long part of the of table to large enough to fit a change pad. Overall happy with the purchase.|4
It's a nice, simple nightstand. For some reason I thought it was wood but it's not. Still, it's for the nursery so it won't get much use. I'm assuming it'll hold up fine. Easy to put together.|4
The toy chest was a bit warped but I got it together and I think it will do just fine. I'm excited that my daughter will be able to enjoy this for a very long time.|4

This chair and ottoman is so cute. It's more pink than lavender in person ~ yet adorable|4
I got this for great nephew, and he loves it. Will have to see how it stands up to wear and tear.|4
I bought this dresser a few weeks ago to go in my nursery. We were looking for something that was a decent price, good quality and a modern look. This dresser definitely fit the bill.My only critic would be that it could be a little more heavy duty but for the price it fulfills what we were looking for.|4
Shipping took a little bit longer than I expected but the price was great for the beautiful bed in the guest room.|4
My husband and I bought this for Christmas for our two girls (2 and 4). Putting it together would have been very easy except for a couple of problems. First, you have to be very careful not to tighten the wood screws that go in the top of the chair back very much. It will split the wood. You can't even get them hand tight. Just enough to hold the pieces together with no gap is all you can do or it starts to crack a little.|4
Best price. My 4 year old loves desk. Good storage n easy to assemble|4
I bought this for my 19 month old daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it and I do too! It's a great size because she can use it now but there is still plenty of room for her to grow and use for a long time to come. She is in it all the time so my mom bought one to keep at her house for my daughter to use when she's over there.|5
I love this little chair. It's adorable. It is actually a bit bigger than I expected which is nice.|5
Did not receive email product had shipped. Took over 2 weeks to receive. Product is hard to clean. Will not be returning to shop there.|1
This is a christmas but I know my grand daughter will love it .It is really cute...|4
My 19 month old daughter received this for Christmas and it's been used daily. This past week, the cushion on the seat has shifted over so a wood support piece is basically exposed and when she sits down, it's right under her. Very disappointed in how long this item lasted.|1
Our son absolutely loves his chair. Only problem we had was it was supposed to be in brown and we got blue, but that was not a big deal. They were very kind and took 10% off to make it better.|5
We bought this chair for a oresent for our 1 year old granddaughter. Cant wait to givd to her. She ttie one out when she sees one in the stores.|5
this is the 3rd chair we purchased, all for one year olds' birthdays!! This chair is so adorable and very light weight, and the kids fit in them just perfect!!!|4
Bought this for a Christmas Present for my daughter. We went away for Christmas so she has literally used it for a week. It already has a small tear it in. Disappointed in the quality of the fabric. My 17 month old loves it though. So we will hold onto it until it totally falls apart.|3
The bed is VERY low to the ground. It's basically on the floor. Not what I imagined|1
Great bed and was very easy to put together. My daughter loves her bed.|5
It was a gift for my grandson he loves that chair to deaf. Just his size.|5
I ordered this chair and it was too small. Not as big as in the picture. I plan to return it.|1
Yes it holds bath tiys but they must be really small in order for the bag to stay on the wall.|3
This is a lovely piece of furniture that looks wonderful in our nursery; the honey oak finish compliments our matching crib and changing table nicely. The piece of furniture itself is solid, and the design is a classic that will grow with the room. The issue we had was with the drawer design. The drawer slides that came with the unit are cheap, and once installed, the drawers are not positioned properly. There is a gap at the top of the drawer. In addition, there is very little support from the slides given to the drawer itself, so it slid out very quickly and would potentially fall out of the main unit; this seems particularly unsafe for a piece of furniture marketed for a child's room. Luckily we were in a position to acquire and install higher quality drawer slides at a minimal cost, which makes the dresser safer and more functional; however, for the base cost of the dresser, having to spend extra to make it functional is slightly disheartening. Overall the dresser is a lovely piece of furniture that unfortunately suffers from some poor design flaws. I would recommend it, but with reservation.|3

I bought this stepstool a couple weeks ago. Came completely disassembled, which was fine. Picture instructions were clear and all parts were there. However, there were two design flaws. One, the inner box floor is extremely thin and could easily be broken with anything remotely heavy stored inside. Secondly, the final pre-drilled holes for the hinges on the lid were not deep enough, and by the time I realized it, I had already stripped the screws. Haven't got around yet to going to the hardware store to buy new screws, drill better holes and re attach lid -- so a bit disappointed. Stool is smaller in width than I expected (I should have done a measurement comparison to older stepstool. The hardwood seems of good quality, the only complaint re the wood I have is the very thin plywood storage box floor.|3
I purchased this as a Christmas Gift to my daughter. It was ordered a week before Christmas with an ETA of 12/28. To my suprise it arrived before Christmas with a couple days to spare. I wished it came in black but I opted to paint it instead. Once done, I discovered I was missing washers and inserts for the seat when putting the vanity together. Rather wait for more hardware from the manufacturer(anticipating my daughters smile), I was left to purchase it at Home Depot. Overall I was very pleased with shipping and the product itself. I wasn't really happy that I had to go out and buy missing hardware.|3
I purchased this for my sons room it took a while to put together , my husband did it all by himself he got the hang of it just follow directions and you will eventually get it done lol . It's pretty flimsy though but I guess for the price it's ok|3
I got this for my 1&1/2 year old daughter for Christmas and she likes it a lot. I was a little disappointed because I didn't realize it was foam and not an upholstered chair. She likes to climb and jump on things which is why we have to have this chair against something or it'll topply over. Also the armrests aren't very steady.|3
I thought it was made of better material. Soft and foamy not as durable as I expected.|2
the pic is deceiving it does not come with a bookshelf.|2
Bought this chair for nursery. It felt comfortable. I added a pillow for back support. Few days later I sat on glider with shorts and short sleeve shirt and I realized how itchy the fabric is. Which is such a bummer. Glider is a bit noisy, maybe it needs to be broken in.|2
I bought this for my adult children. Thinking it was for adults, not children. Not the case!! Disgusted I wasted $89 because they refuse to return it!!|1
Bought this to organize my closet. It's huge, sturdy and of good quality. The price was awesome. Will definitely buy more.|5
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH READY TO BUY SOME MORE.ITS VERY ROOMY. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO A FRIEND.|5
I love this storage tote, it is perfect for the storage of blankets in the family room.|5
I was looking for this toy box on line and found that Burlington had the best deal. Before this I wouldn't have thought to look at Burlington. It also arrived in a few days, good shipping. I like that the toy box has small drawers on the bottom. Just right for Legos.|5
It holds a lot of toys and is very sturdy. It fits nicely in our living room.|5
Love it!!! Very spacious for lots of toys (large and small) and I like the bottom bins for the little toys. Happy that they are just under it and not attached it makes it easier for the kids to put away. Used by two rambunctious two year old boys.|5
Very nice quality - love the colors, materials, etc., but it is a bit slouchy - good and bad. I wish it was a little less flexible and a little more rigid, but it is definitely very nicely made and it adds sophistication to the bottom of my closet and will keep things looking neat!|5
Love this product! Sturdy with quality fabric. Can't wait to get more.|5
Had one and bought a second one to stack on top. Perfect for toys and comes with a bracket for stacking!|5

Bought this for my kitchen counter to act as decor & fruit storage. Looks great & is very roomy - fits approx. 10 apples in the bottom basket & a banana bunch in the top basket. It's sturdy & makes for cute decor piece.|5
It's the perfect little fruit/banana holder. I am able to comfortably fit 3 pieces of fruit underneath the bananas. Keeping fruit on the counter encourages me to stick to a healthy diet.|5
Ordered 20 Post Mardi Gras Recovery Baskets were a HIT!!!!!!! Client absolutely loved them.|5
I have been looking for a flatware tray for quite a while - although I have come across may trays - none can compare to this - it's classy looking, fit into my kitchen drawer with a little room left over (which is no problem) and I am very pleased with my purchase.|5
My daughter loves it. Very sturdy, and storage compartments are a very nice size. Putting it together was a bit tricky because the parts aren't labeled as they are in the instructions.|4
Before Xmas, I looked for this online; it was either out of stock or overpriced. I was extremely happy to find it at BCF for great price and shipping was super fast! Awesome!!!|5

The toy chest was a bit warped but I got it together and I think it will do just fine. I'm excited that my daughter will be able to enjoy this for a very long time.|4

Yes it holds bath tiys but they must be really small in order for the bag to stay on the wall.|3
I bought this product to replace my current trashcan in the kitchen. The box was in good condition, but when we took the trashcan out it had a huge dent on the side. We returned the item.|1
Bought the lamps for the guest bedroom. It really makes the overall room. Receive lots of compliments.|5
My daughter needed cookies to take into work. Of course, that means I was baking. Used this mix and had delicious cookies ready to go in a snap. One-bowl to clean too!|5
I bought three of these cookie mixes for gifts. They came quickly and wrapped so cute. Definitely recommend!|5

This product came well packaged to prevent damage and matches my room perfect!|5
I just hung my picture up and I love it! Not only do I love it but my husband loves it as well. Great purchase!|5
I didn't open any of my purchases until I actually moved today. I opened this and I was in shock! It's very high quality, much more beautiful than it looks online, large size, just gorgeous! I could not be happier! This would have cost a fortune elsewhere! Do not hesitate to purchase. It's a great deal!!|5
I was remodeling my room and wanted something that stood out, but not in a bad way. This clock is beautiful! I get soooo many compliments on it, and for the price it's a great deal!|5
Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|5
Great picture and quality -
Packaging was perfect too- love this new addition to my decor|5
I was looking for an abstract wall art set to mount between my living room windows.|5
I love the metal wine racks! I had been looking around for a while.|5
Had to reorder, because the first one came damaged. The second piece was not damaged, but the colors were not as vibrant. Am thinking of returning again. Realize it is metal work, but the coloring should be the same.|3
I bought this picture about two weeks ago, didn't take long to arrive at all. Beautiful picture but the quality of the frame is very poor. Weighs maybe 5 pounds and there is no glass on the frame which I thought it would be.|3
The photo shows the scroll as black, the description states it as brown; however, it is actually brass/gold. The size and shape was so great that I chose to keep and paint it. After applying a couple coats of antique bronze spray paint, it is up on my wall and I love it!|3
I bought this about a week ago, it is nice but don't go by the picture that's shown. The actual color is like a brownish gold color. Not sure if i'm gonna keep it and just spray paint it or if it is going back.|1
I love the metal wine racks! I had been looking around for a while.|5
Great item. Just what I wanted for summer dining and entertaining.|5
I bought two sets, they arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Very happy with my purchase!|5

I just bought these glasses paid so much and they are plastic|1
We got three of them and we love them, very confortable|5
Brought it 1-14-16 in store. All I want to do is sleep.|5
I got this a week ago and my husband and I have been sleeping so well. Our mattress is a bit old and uncomfortable and this has improved it.|5
The product is very good, good cotton and nice color|5
I bought a set of sheets. I love the the color the feel. They are very comfortable and soft. Great buy!|5
It was exactly what I was looking for!!! Beautiful colors and fits my bed perfectly.|5
This is the most soft and luxurious blanket! It melts like butter when you surround yourself with it. It keeps you warm and feels so good against your skin. Wonderful blanket!|5
Bought this for ourselves and are really pleased with it. Enough so, that we wouldn't hesitate to buy one as a gift. Soft, warm, and cuddly.|5
This throw is gorgeous!!! Deep, rich colors and so,so soft. The sale price was fantastic. Highly recommend.|5
Purched 2 twin Velvet Plush blankets to use as bedspreads in my guest room.
Very vibrant color, snuggly soft, much better than I expected for the price.
Was able to find same color window coverings in store. My room has a bright, happy look.|5
It felt sooo good sleeping on the bed it was like sleeping on a cloud and the shipping was fast too came before the expected date|5
Very nice and comfortable fits my cal-king mattress perfect love it|5
I love these sheets they're so soft and cozy. Makes me real comfortable|5
This throw is gorgeous!!! Deep, rich colors and so,so soft. The sale price was fantastic. Highly recommend.|5
Love the set. I have gotten so many compliments on it already. The grey side is super soft and the fabric is of very nice quality, not cheap or polyester like. Definitely a great bargain.|4
Very nice comforter set! Super soft and the fabric doesn't look like cheap polyester, but beware it DRY CLEAN ONLY! The reverse is a nice shade of grey.|4
Purchased two twin sheet sets (500 thread count). One set had stains on the top sheet the other had stains on the bottom sheet. None of the stain came out after washing. Such a hassle to return things I'll just keep them but would NOT recommend others to purchase. They also wrinkled badly after washing.|1
Very pleased with the sateen sheets, excellent color fabric and queen size fit to the bed|5
Beutiful!!! Love the fabric, the color, the quality. Great product.|5
I bought this blanket a couple weeks ago and washed it 3 times and black fuzz balls are still falling off of it and going everywhere. I have black fuzz over all my clothes. This blanket is horrible quality.|1
Feel very pleased with this item! Now that winter is here, I feel very happy to buy it. A very good item. Love it.|5
Soft, warm, and cuddly. Would definitely purchase again for myself or as a gift.|5
I am picky about the softness and this blanket is kinda scratchy and the design is felt. The pillows are flat and squished. The sheets are soft and nice.|3
Unfortunately, when these sheets arrived, I realized that they were the same as a set I already have and dislike. They look good and wash well, but tI find sleeping on polyester material uncomfortable. Back they went!|3
I originally bought this set at the store however when we got it home it was torn at the seem. We really liked the color as we just painted our accent wall chocolate. We took a chance and ordered it online and when we received it we noticed that it was torn at multiple seams. The material was bad quality and the seams were not sown correctly.|1
The cover and pillow cases looks great and feel great. But tear up easily, material i guess.|2
Not as large as I thought it would be, but my Grandson Loved it. Took a minute to charge and after that he was flying it all over.|4
The price of this product on Burlington's website is good because it is $30 through other vendors. The packaging causes the vinyl to fold funny, but this isn't Burlington's fault. This is a nice indoor toy for a kid, the balls are soft and the game is easy to set up. It's not a tough toy, so if your kids are rough or older, it may not be a good fit for them. But if you have a kid who likes playing catch or you need a toy to take on a trip, this is a great activity to have on hand.|4
Love my new back pack! It has so many compartments enough room for my text books! And laptop!|5
I've had this since September and love it! Everything fits nicely. Has a space for my laptop and tablet|5
We desperately needed a new sturdy backback. This one is designed for comfort and is heavy duty. I bought it for school but he likes to carry it everywhere. There is even a compartment for a laptop. It is so comfortable too! He LOVES it! I am definitely purchasing another one for my youngest son as well. :)|5
Great quality speedy delivery easy to order. I had no issues|5
Great article for a gift and excellent price than the other stores|5
This is a super comfortable and sturdy laptop backpack! I love all the compartments to organize my things, and the padded carrying handle. Great color too!|5
Arrived quickly and it's hilarious and big enough to fit a lot of stuff!|5
I got this for my backpack for school and it last for two years|5
My son is a full-time college student and I felt like he needed something compact but sturdy. It's versatile. It can carry his laptop. Perfect!|5
I was going to give it to my daughter but I ended up keeping myself. the style reminded me of my old backpack as a kid. It has a lot of room for a weekend get away.|5
Bought over a month ago, works perfect in daughters room|5

I bought this set and fell in love when it arrived. However the measurements of the largest suitcase would have put me over by 2 inches for checked in luggage. It was sad to return the set. Really loved it.|5
I love my new Luggage that my Daughter want a set for her and family.|5
I bought it about a 2 weeks ago for a trip I have to Florida and it's more than expected I'm over the moon with this purchase.|5
I bought this luggage for our honeymoon cruise. It was able to fit all of our things. I love that it comes with the optional sizes. This is what sold me on purchasing the luggage. The handle on the largest suitcase has since bent. I'm going to return it and get a replacement. Overall we like it for the price we paid.|4
I ordered this item and it was not in stock. It took sometime, before they informed me that this item was no longer available. I decided to go to one of the stores and they only had one set of luggage left and it was the Royal Blue assorted luggage's. It was my Blessed day. I am happy that I was able to get it, although I preferred to have the Black Set. it is back on-line again? Afraid to order and find out it is out of stock.|4
I loved it, exactly what i was looking for, great material, would definitely recommend it!!|5
I brought this about a month ago and used it for my first trip and I loved it. The only negative thing is the little lock eventually chipped on me, so I need to get another lock. Overall I am satisfied with my luggage set.|5
I love the varying sizes and the overall design is lovely. For some reason I thought it would be bigger but that is not an issue. For the price it is definitely a great buy.|5
The socks are terrific and fit perfectly. I'm glad I purchased two packs. The multiple colors go well with different colored outfits. Less sweaty feet while exercising.|5
I very happy with my slippers. The are very soft and comfortable.|5
My daughter and i both love it. The sz is great with braids and warm enough for the cold too. It has become her college staple head gear. Got it in grey went back for the brown and there was no more :-). heart broken|5
I needed a new hat. I love it. The button sits it off.|5
I was pleased with the fit and comfort of the belt.|5
I purchased this curling iron for myself for Christmas. It was wrapped and under the tree, but I was so excited to try it, I opened it before Christmas. It was a total disappointment. It's very, very hard to use. I'm not a beautician, but I've been curling/styling my hair all my life. I KNOW how to use a curling iron. OH, it did curl my hair. Unfortunately, the curl was wonky, curled the wrong direction and with funky marks on my hair. Also, I did slightly burn my finger once and the palm of my hand as well. No major burns thank goodness. I was also thinking of purchasing this form my 13 year old grand-daughter. I won't after my personal experience with it. I'll be shipping this back very soon.|1
it was a gift. the person did give me feedback. I 'm like, I have wanted to have one like this|3
This was my first time purchasing from Burlington online and I was please with my order|5
Stretchy nice material. Love them! Nice fit. Very comfortable.|5
I purchased these Capris for my teen age niece who is very hard to please. She loved them. Thank you for a great product.|5
Very nice, comfy, and the price is right. Will definitely recommend to a friend!|5
These pants are actually butt-lifting! Tgey are true to size! These pants are comfortable as well!|5
These pants are true to size and accentuate your hips!|5
I RECEIVED THE PANTS A WEEK AGO. THEY FIT PERFECTLY. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK IN SATISFACTION TO YOUR CUSTOMERS!|5
Love the higher waist, very comfortable, and love the slight flare leg.|5
However I don't wear capri's and these are a short ankle style. They fit so good though I'm going to make them work for spring. (or boots) My legs are VERY slim, at 5'10" and 125# so most skinny jeans/jeggings are still baggy. These fit GREAT!!!|5
I ordered these jeans online and I am very pleased with the fit. I wish I could get this same jean in different colors. I am short with hips and this pair of pants fit perfect and are comfortable.|5
I bought them and I hate taking them off to wash I love them. their my fav pair of jeans|5
Never seen my daughter so happy says "I hooked her up"|5
I just bought these, and they are very comfortable. Very pleased with my purchase.|5
As a plus size woman, it was great to find a pair of fashionable pants that fit right and slimmed at the same time. It was great to discover the conversion chart for women's size to Junior's Plus. As a lot of women's plus size clothes are not in fashion with today's style, its good to know a variety of options is available to me by using the conversion chart and purchasing Junior's plus size items.|5
I brought these over a month ago I believe. I haven't actually worn them out but I did try them on .. Perfect fit and what I was looking for... comfortable and affordable|5
I purchased both the blush tone and the khaki color... they not only look & feel great... the quality is better than I anticipated!!!|5
When I saw these the pastel color said spring. Love the fit and feel. Would love to have a pair in pale blue.|4
I haven't worn since purchase. I'm debating on whether to return or keep. I thought these were regular active pants, but after receipt the merchandise tag listed as sleepwear. The color is great because they remind me of summer.|4
I bought them for my daughters but I bought one for myself earlier. It fits well and the quality is good|4
Misread description ... Hipster, but didn't think the crotch would be that uncomfortable! Way too low, not for me. The seams in front were not where most seams feel. Gotta return.|3
The lining is really nice to the skin, much warming than I thought on a winding day, and the arm length is what I needed.|5
The silk lining she likes
The color combo she loves
Durable zipper / snaps
Thick
Affordable|5
I bought this as a gift for my cousin. She's about 85 pounds and 5 feet tall. The arms are a little long but she loves it. It's very soft and thick so it makes for a good winter coat without being too bulky.|5
Great value and beautiful style! My daughter loves it...|5
I bought this jacket, because I was wanted a spring jacket. I am 22 and more on the petite side so when looking at the woman's jacket, I could already invision myslef drowning, ha. So I decided to take a look at the Junior jackets, and they looked perfect the sizing chart also helped a bunch. I got the jacket in a small and I still have room. It's a light jacket with a nice lining, so it keeps you warm but it's not overbearing, but it's also so fashionable. I have received ma y compliments and one of the girls said she likes it so much she wants one for herself. The color is an olive and different from those army green jackets I see everywhere, my favorite feature is the drawstring :) You should purchase this jacket you'll be glad you did.|5
Right color of red and I love the way it fit. Thanks|5
Bought it for my daughter for a spring jacket as well as part of her "Paddington" costume for Book day at school. She won first place for her costume and she loves the jacket and wears it daily now! Only drawback, jacket is navy blue and cotton, so it collects every white dog hair in our house..... lint roller takes care of that just fine, though.|5
I bought this a couple of weeks ago. Very nice fabric|5
This coat is nice and warm, the fur around the hood really keeps the wind and cold out. This particular garment tends to run small and I could have gone with a size bigger, which is something to keep in mind. The price was very reasonable and I am very glad I bought it.|5
purchased this jacket an gave it to my grand daughter, she loves it!|5
I got a great deal on this coat and I love it so much!|5
I bouth this jacket for my daughter and she loved nice and warm.|5
Bought for a Christmas gift, it was a big hit! Every girl there wanted one!!|5
my wife loves the coat. it made me feel good to see her smile.|5
I ordered it online and was happy when I got it because it fit perfectly. It keeps me warm and it has a hood in case it rains, an added bonus. I like that it has a zipper and I like the color.|5
This jacket feels amazing. It keeps me very warm, it's very good for the cold weather|5
I bought these Items about an month ago and everything fits perfect*********|5
I needed a lightwright coat suitable for outside bus duty and my winter coat is too heavy now. This coat fits perfectly, is long enough for being covered in the rain, and has a hood. My daughter said she really liked it too! I bought it in Navy-size small. I wear a 6 in ladies and am 5' 5". At this price, I can get another!|5
Wasnt expecting it to fit me ..but it did! and it looks awesome! mine is Green-Military. Light not heavy. Good shipping and fast! Recommend it!|5
I ordered this jacket in black and I love it. It's very stylish and you can't beat the price. I ordered a small and it fits great.|5
Very well made and the length is good. Lots of pockets for when you're traveling. Runs small so order a size up.|5
This jacket is trendy and is a great length. The only thing is that the hood comes too far over the eyes when the hood is on, but other than that the jacket fits well and is light weight.|4
Love the fabric and design, too bad I didn't pay special attention to the Junior size, got a 2XL but still too small.|5
Purchased this jacket in black and its perfect for this Houston bipolar weather!!|5
It looks perfect on me. Whenever I wear it, people keep asking me where I got it|5
I thought that it would be too small since it was Jr. Plus. And I would've had to take it to the store for an exchange. But it fitted perfect. With a little more room to spare.|5
I brought this coat a month ago and I absolutely love it...I recommend anyone to purchase this coat|5
I purchased a size 2X online so I'd have enough room to wear sweaters or layers but coat fitted too large so I returned it to the store which was a smooth process hoping to get a smaller size but it wasn't available. However, the coat was nice looking and would of kept me warm.|4
This coat is super warm and lightweight. I'm glad I bought it. Fits perfectly. I'm a busty woman & I have no problems with zipping.|5
I wish that I would have purchased it in black too. This coat is super light and super warm. I LOVE the holes in the sleeve for my thumb.|5
I just got my jacket a week ago and I love the way it looks on me|5
I bought a coat about a month ago - good purchase.|4
Got the medium size and it just fits right. Im petite 5'0 $130lbs. Love the style especially the price. If you want room for thick shirt or sweater get the Large. I live in a state where its no cold all the time. So I only use light shirt underneath.|5
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it, but beware - it runs a little small.|4
This is a very nice looking jacket, I wish I could have fit in it. Very stylish|5
I just bought this tonight in store
omg so very warm|5
Purchased online and am very happy with the fit and look. I only wish I qualified for the free shipping.|4
I bought this for myself a couple of weeks ago. I love it, however it runs very small.|4
I brought this a few weeks ago it's warm and I liked the style of it.that shipping was great to with a few days I received my product love it..I got it at a reasonable price too|4
I bought this coat last week just before it got cold. Perfect to wear now, kept me warm and comfortable.|5
It's soo comfortable, and very warm. I received a lot of compliments about it|5
Bought the cost but I had to send it back to small.|3
Roomy and adjustable, this cute rain slicker is a must! The fit is true to size and has ability to cinch at the waist if you want a more form flattering silhouette. The only disappointments were the false top pockets and dummy zippers. The pockets below the waist are deep and can easily stash a large cellphone like the note 4 or 6 plus.|4
I ordered this a few weeks ago for a weekend getaway when I found out it might be rainy. It came within a few days, it fit perfectly (I just went by the size guide in the website, taking measurements) and is even more attractive in person. It was good for rainy and windy conditions. Great find for such a reasonable price!|5
I bought this jacket, but i wish the jackets top pockets were actual pockets|3
when this coat arrived, i was not impressed with it in the package, but once I put it on, I was so happy I bought it. it is all about the fit with this coat and it is very complimentary|5
Nice coat, shipped promptly but sadly was too small. Seemed to run a bit small.|3
I bought this jacket about a month ago! It has been pretty good so far.|4
Great size shape and color. Exactly what I needed and wanted|5
When buying this jacket, it does run super small, I usually wear a medium however I had to buy an extra large for this jacket to fit.|4
I purchase this coat for my daughter. She loves it, however, in my opinion a little on the thin side. The hood fits snug around the face.|4
I purchase this coat for my daughter. She loves it, however, in my opinion a little on the thin side. The hood fits snug around the face.|4
I bought them for my daughters and theye really love them|4
Warm, cozy, and very fashionable. Bought it for my niece and she loves it! Definitely going back to Burlington !|4
Only had it for a month but satisfied with the outcome.|5
I wish it was a little longer but overall great purchase!!!!!! The fur on the hood is very soft and fits well|5
This coat is ok, but they sewed the fur into the seam on the hood. I wear it sans hood.|3
I ordered this coat last month and it had 5 holes in it and day to day the holes got bigger and bigger the quality of this coat is so cheap it will keep you warm. Alittle but you will not survive and wett weather with thia coat i rate 0|1
I bought this coat two weeks ago for my daughter. I love the color. My daughter loves the coat. It fits her perfectly. I would certainly recommend it to others.|5
Good looking jacket but not quite warm enough even with a sweater underneath. Good for wearing in a car. The collar is warm but the zipper is not covered therefore it's annoying and cold. Also didn't like the strings hanging from the back of the jacket|3
I bought this about a couple of months ago and it fits my 15yr old daughter well!|3
Love the coat, fits perfectly, light weight and not bulky.|5
I saw this jacket in another store and could never find my size and was double the price! Looked on Burlington's website and I find it in my size for $25! I wore it to my works Christmas party and it was a hit!|5
I usually wear a "small" but ordered a "medium" and it was ridiculously small - like for a child. I was so disappointed.|1
When I selected this jacket was looking forward to it cause it has the hoodie come to find out is not women size was sad about it|1
It's a great buy for the quality and cost
I will purchase another one for my other daughter for Christmas mo NJ|5
I thought a Junior large I could wear but I actually need a XL even though bust said 38.5 inches. Loved the jacket probably have daughter try it on before I have to return it to the store. Love the color, the crop length. I usually wear a woman's large.|3
This coat was ok...I purchased the grey one for my daughter who has no problem wearing a Medium Junior size...so we went up to a size large hoping she might be able to wear it next year. This "coat" runs WAY SMALL! The sleeves were 2 inches too short and when she raised her arms the bottom of the coat showed her belly button, and there was no way she was gonna be able to cross her arms if bundled up. We've purchased several coats lately from Burlington and all of them seem to run very small. This will make 2 that I have had to return due to not fitting and it's really just not worth it, I won't be buying from here again. Also, this is more like a heavy jacket...hardly heavy enough to call a coat.|3
This coat runs very small! Now I have to return it!!!|1
I bought this in the size I usually buy that will cover a ladies suit or sweaters. It was so small that it wouldn't even close. It was not available 3 sizes larger or I would have rebought, It was a beautiful, soft coat.|1
I purchased this coat about 2 weeks ago and the coat has now began to show snags and it has busted on the side.I would like to be refunded my money or get anot her coat of my choice...|1
I bought this a month ago and Im so happy that I did.|5
I bought this dress in mint a few weeks ago and I'm so happy that I did! The color is gorgeous and it fits well. I did have to order a size larger than I normally do, though because it is a fit and flare style.|5
It's so comfy and the colors are beautiful!! Couldn't be more please!|5
Very pretty, good quality not cheap looking, very comfortable material.|5
I love my dress ! It looks even better than I thought. It was very inexpensive and looks like it would be an expensive dress. I couldn't be happier. It is for my cousins wedding and is perfect!|5
Simply gorgeous! It's the perfect length and just stunning! Only 'issue' with it, is you'll need to wear a slip underneath, as it's very sheer.|5
The dress is more pretty than I imagined! It looks great contrasted with black! I love it and it was such a good deal!|4
The dress is a nice rose color gold. I thought it was just plain gold sequins, but they had a nice pink tint to them! An added bonus! The dress is a size 3 and is true to size. The cut outs are a nice touch, yet doesn't reveal your bra like many do. The sequins are not scratchy except a little on the bottom. The only con is, some sequins shed a bit, but still in good condition. It came curled up in a tiny package, the only other con, but didn't wrinkle luckily! It goes great with solid black tights and a black cardigan! Great for fancy events!|4
I bought this dress according to the size charts - knowing as a woman, that if ordering a Jr sizing it would likely mean a size or two larger than what I would normally wear. The size chart also indicated that. Unfortunately, the dress arrived today and is definitely women's sizing and is WAY too big - fortunately I can still get it in a smaller size, but having to pay priority shipping to get it again is frustrating when I went out of my way to take measurements and compare it to the chart. Hopefully the second order fits.|4
Great organizer. It's slightly bigger than a regular wallet. You can grab this and run in the store if you don't want to carry your whole purse.|5
Love it the price is great better than other stores|5
I bought this bag for my aunt as a thank you gift and it is more that what I expected, very sturdy and will be ordering one for myself.|5
Beautiful soft leather - just not right size for me. But perfect bag overall|5
It has plenty of room for all the cards money and change.|5
the color is amazing good quality, I love the spaces of the wallet|5
Nice evening bag. Just the right size for the essentials|4
The website said they only had 2 2XL left so I bought this thinking it would be 1-2 sizes too big (typically wear L or XL depending on brand and cut). However, when I received it and tried it on, it definitely fits more like a large than a 2XL. I'm still glad I bought it because they are nice and comfortable but I would definitely purchase a size larger than you think you need.|3
My daughter saw these in one of your stores but they did not have them in her size. I lucked up and found them online. A surprise Christmas present for her!|5
beware i bought these and used the sizing chart and went a size up then intended and the item didnt even go above my knees! waste of money|1
I bouth this jacket for my daughter and she loved nice and warm.|5
I purchased this ring a month ago and I am very pleased with it, It is gorgeous, the picture does not do justice.I recommend this.|5
I'm so happy with this purchase beautiful ring!! Love it, true to size!|5
I love the length, not to long, not too short.....|5
I bought this set of 3 earrings to go on vacation and it was nice that they are 3 totally different looks so I could wear a different pair each night!|5
my granddaughter was looking for something to go with an outfit. this is going to be perfect, can't wait for her to see it.|5
Fast service,quick delivery,easy, just open laptop and easy to see products. Items, when open, are what they looked like when ordered.|5
I bought these earrings for my daughter and they are beautiful!. They are bigger than I expected but nonetheless, very beautiful. Now I need a pair for me :)|5
Exceeded my expectations, simply glamorous bling, bling|5
Absolutely beautiful and comfortable to wear. Love it|5
I purchased these online for my wife, they were very attractive and large hoops as stated , but no where on the pieces was there a sterling silver stamping which gives rise to the possibility that they are not,... unless you see them in the store or absolutely verified as Sterling Silver in the future , I would ask questions.|3
Ring could have at least been in a box or something instead of taped plastic|3
2 pair were the same color, 1 pair was a different color. I have 3 holes in each ear, so it looks funny wearing them all together|3
This item is an exceptional value. However, I cannot wear the hoops; they are way too big.|2
I loved these shoes so much that I bought them in 3 colors! Very cute, and I received many compliments!|5
I bought 2 weeks ago.this boot is amazing and comfortable, I love it.i just looking for buying another one but I can see ..|5
Bought 2 pairs, one for my mom and one for me. We both really liked them.|5
I bought these two weeks ago, I loved them wore them all night and were super comfortable all day, I will re purchase in different color now. I did however buy half a size down.|5
This is a beautiful coat!!! I'm glad I picked the Tall version for my 6'3" boyfriend. It fits him perfectly except for the waistband, which is a little snug and is not elastic. However, he can still get it zipped and leather, even faux leather, tends to stretch out over time so I'm not worried. There were a few loose threads along the zipper upon arrival, but they were easily removed. It's really soft and very attractive, and hopefully will last a long time.|5
I love this Jacket! It's sad, that other department stores, don't offer amazing choices for Big & Tall. I will cherish this coat for years to come!|5
I bought this item a few weeks ago. I thoroughly enjoyed the jacket. Thank you for timely delivery, nice look and great fit.|5

American coin treasures santa money clips. Purchased as giflts. They appear well made, sturdy and attrative.|5
Super good value! Best value for the money. I may buy more later|5
Very well made! Very stylish, I get several compliments!|5
I bought this for my son as a stocking stuffer, he had been growing a beard since the first of November. Well he went into the bathroom to try it out and shaved nearly all of his face off. He loved the product so much he couldn't stop with the trimming. He looks good with what he has now not the bear he had became.|5
These worked out great! Just what was needed and they will be used. Easier to iron than 100 percent cotton. Should have bought another packet. Arrived in time for the birthday and great quality.|5
This purchase was a Christmas gift for my son. He said he didn't want a bulky scarf and this set was perfect.|5
I bought this an month ago and my lover was happy, thank you for the on time shipping|5

Not bulky but still warm. Fits true to size. Very nice look. Bought for a teenage boy who loved it|5
Bought it loved it.................................|5
Great shirt.....love the quality..my husband love it.|5
This shirt is really good for a casual day at the office or just to wear with a pair of jeans. I am 6,1 tall and about 180lbs. My arms are long sometimes a medium fit my torso but sleeves aren't long enough for my arms. However, this shirt does the job.|5
great price...nice quality...my style...free shipping|5
Looks classy... My XL is on the smallish end of the XL scale but OK.|5
The shirt is slightly over-sized for me but the smaller size would have been too small. Impossible to find perfectly sized shirts, but this one will do.|4
Bought a 4x. Only 2 out of the 20 shirts i bought did not fit me.|2
I bought this for my nephew and he loves it. Fits him great|5
Over all this is of good quality for a good value.|4
i didnt like it when i got it......to thin and wasnt the color i thought it was going to be.|3
Ordered shirt a size larger than usual it was still to small not happy|1
Unbelievable! The Burlington price tag said Sz L but the shirt itself was a XXL!!|1
Ordered shirts a size larger than usual still to small never again..,.|1
I don't know how they size, but I've been wearing 3X for many years and when I tried this and two other shirts that I bought in 3X they all fit like they were "Larges". It was impossible to put them on. I'll never buy clothing online. I did return them to a store which was easy, but I still lost my shipping fees. Not fair!|1
Size not even right I wanting 5xl more just XL no money to seng back|1
It was really great, I loved how many pockets it came with and also the suspenders on the inside to give added support. Over all great coat, just gotta wait to break it in once winter actually starts haha.|5
i bought this jacket for xmas i know he will lovw item this is my 2nd jacket from your co. i know he ll love itburlington have great products looking forward foing more business in the future.... karen|5
I bought this jacket as a much needed Christmas gift for my husband. He loves it! It's perfect for those cold drizzly days. Especially since the fur lining on the hood is detachable!|5
This jacket answers the need for warmth. It is stylish and has storage galore. The price was awsome and way lower then what it would cost in retail stores.|5
Got it for brother and dad for their fishing adventures. Quality is great! Warm and they loves it!|5
I bought 2 jackets in black for birthday presents and they loved them,|5
I brought my coat about a month ago and I am totally satisfied|5

Am very happy with the online ordering process and love my coat|5
I bought it a week ago and it is warm, waterproof, and very flexible|5
We needed a sturdy, warm jacket for an active boy and kids coats were not lasting. This is a sturdy, well built jacket that should last the season.|5
Had this new jacket for about three weeks and very pleased with it and it looks sharp! I bought the blue with black accents.|5
I live the jacket it runs big but I like that since I dress in layers|5
I bought it for my son, he wasn't cold at all when he was standing out in the elements . He is 6'4 and the length of the jacket and arms were perfect|5
Just got it a few weeks ago. It's good and warm and flexible to remove the hood and fur and comfortable to wear. Worth the money.|5
My mom and I purchased this for my brother in AZ. He works outside in the evenings. He says that it is wonderful so far!|5
Bought 5 winter coats for my grandsons and was very happy with the fit and the design also the quality of all 5 coats.|5
I bought this coat as a gift and the person bought for loves it. It's full and warm so it has no need really for any extra layering or anything like that. They also said it's optional to wear a hat because the hood is so warm and full as well. Overall the coat was a great buy and the sizing is accurate and the color (ice) is beautiful!|5
This coat is great! Very warm, great for Winter and looks better in person than online.|5
Fit the boyfriend wonderfully and is still keeping him warm.|5
I bought this jacket for my husband and he loves it.|5
Purchased this jacket for my 11 year old son who is tall and slim in a large...fits him perfect and will last him for 2-3 more years...this coat was perfect in weight and look...this is his Sunday wear coat for cold mornings to church.|5
My son loves his new ski jacket he said it is so warm. Fits great.|5
I bought this as a gift and the receiver loved the jacket. The puffer style and the blue color look great and the light weight and warmth were perfect for the weather here.|5
Beautiful Jacket! Light, durable and stylish.
I bought my husband a new jacket to replace an old one he had for years.
He just loves it.|5
I very recently received it. Seems like a good quality jacket.|5

I bought this jacket for my nephew and he absolutely loved the look and fit of the jacket. The quality was great for the price! We were both very happy with the jacket and shipping was super fast! I will definitely buy again on line!|5
Bought this for Christmas for my grandson, he loves it. The fit was perfect. Perfect for my 15 year old who likes to layer, not bulky, but keeps him warm.|5
The jacket really blocks wind and keeps the cold out. I just wasn't crazy about the hood. It doesn't quite sit right on your head. The pockets are deep too|5
This is a very good coat for any kind of storm around east coast!|5
Very nice price. Runs a little big but you have to wear it in top of your clothes.|5
Not bulky but still warm. Fits true to size. Very nice look. Bought for a teenage boy who loved it|5
I bought this a month ago and so glad I did. Thanks|5
I got the jacket at a great price and it shipped quickly.|5

Simple styling a really beautiful shirt.I have plenty of dress shirts all with french cuffs.
This is my favorite shirt now. If you knew me,
You would know what I'm saying.|5
The color, style and cuffs are great. The shirt fits well|5
Great product fit perfectly great pricing awsome shirt|5
Shirts were a perfect fit and the tailoring was reflected a well made product. Very Happy with my shirts and will order again.|5
I love this shirt. My son loved the material so much we order 4 more in different colors. It is hot here in Texas and this material is nice and comfortable and short sleeve for the price. A great buy!|5
bought this shirt due to searching for color and in the process found out this was an excellent shirt and has great value|5
I PLUS SIZE WOMAN AND LIKE LOOSELY FITTING TOPS AND I REMEMBER WEARING MY SONS SHIRTS WHEN THEY DISCARDED THEM SO AM HAPPY WITH THIS SHIRT|5
The quality, price and color are out of this world!!|5
I bought it for a gift for my husband, he loves it ,so do I.It is a very nice shirt|5
The shirt, bowtie and suspenders go well together. The suspenders, however, are somewhat difficult to adjust.|4
I am looking forward to getting even more of your box sets Great value.|5
This product is a little big for me but is ok I later give it to my brother|2
bought this expecting your average printed tee but this is actually more of the ironed on graphic so to speak. Every detail is thick and it literally covers the entirety of the front of the shirt from seam to seam the graphic stops just before hitting the back of the shirt and before hitting the sleeves. Great quality for the price will definitely last a long time. Recommend hand wash hang dry to keep in good condition.|5
I had to buy new T-shirts since I lost weight. This one fit the bill.|5
Bought some shirts at good prices and the shipping was fast .|4
I should have purchased a medium the large runs alittle big|4
Big clothes for a big man at a good price that's my place.|5

My boyfriend bought this suit a few months back and absolutely loves it! The fit is great & he gets a ton of use out of it. He uses it for work & social events and can always switch up the look. The slim fit & navy blue coloring are super stylish and look great - he receives compliments all the time! I would highly recommend this suit - great look for an affordable price, can't beat it! :)|5

Bought this for my husband on father's day and it is an amazing fit. I would recommend getting measured by a tailor to ensure the right size. Only thing I didn't like was the size selection was limited so the pants didn't fit as well as the jacket and will have to be taken in|4
Great suit and can't beat the price..... The sticky/ticky prices are best in market and BCF has a ton of product and inventory !!! No better store in market my only suggestion is, if u see what u want, grab it b/c stuff flys off the shelves b/c of above.....great store !!!|5
Purchased this suit for an interview because blue (navy) is the best color to wear. Landed the job and couldn't have been more confident in this suit!|5
I bought these pants for my picky son and he loved them. He looks great in slim fit pants and will be wearing these for quite a while.|5

I bought this jacket for my boyfriend to wear to work. It seemed perfect for him but the material is so cheap the jacket sleeve tore after not even a full day of wear. It tore in the actual sleeve and not at the seem so it cannot even be fixed. What a waste of money!|2
I ordered this at the last minute for my sons prom keepong my fingers crossed when it got here it was absolutely gorgeous..my son was the talk of the prom he looked outstanding in this suit..|5

They fit excellently and arrived quickly. Can't wait to shop for the next item from Burlington online!!!|5
The description says it has cuffed legs, and the photo also shows trousers with leg cuffs. However, both pairs shipped (separately) to me did not have cuffed legs.|1

The shirt is 100 polyester and retains its shape after washing.
I have five different colors now.
Great for golf or other casual activities.|5

shirt fits nice and so far is holding up nicely with the washing/drying.|4
I bought this one a week ago , I am really like it.|4
Love the colors, the price and the shipping discount. What ca I say, I'm a Burlington fan.|5
Very Comfortable show......highly recommended......|5
I'm really happy i bought these boots, i don't have to worry about my feet getting wet anymore|5
I like the fact that they are waterproof. and durable. Great price as well.|5
I bought this shoe about 3 weeks ago. My friends liked it & they are shoe very comfortable.|5
I bought these very nice shoes well worth it ! "You Really get Excellent quality"|5
Great quality, nice craftsmanship. Bought them for my Buddy in the black color, even thought the brown look real nice too! They are the perfect combination of rugged and stylish!|5
happy for the price I got the shoes for. it was a great deal.|5
I just bought these after looking around town for something similar. I am so glad I waited and got these on line. They are exactly what I wanted.|5
I purchase these shoes about 2 months ago in the department store. I bought the brown with orange stitching and the black with red stitching...both pair are great. i bought them for work. They are nice looking, comfortable and casual work, play and go out shoes.|5
Actually was looking for a leather coat but wound up w/shoes.. Fit very well|5
I've gone running with these shoes twice in a week, both times 5 miles plus. They feel good, nice cushion, feet don't hurt after the run. Gotta get a second pair to keep in the closet as a backup.|5
My son really likes them and they fit his big feet.|4
bought these slip-ons for my spouse. He really likes them. They are comfortable and are a nice diversion from sneakers.|4
I bought these for my husband. They aren't fancy boots, but they are really good for everyday living. They are wide and have a spacious, round toebox. They keep out mud, but be warned, they pick up the mud too. Get your boot scraper onto the porch!|4
Can not wear too small. Shoes need to be men sizes.|3
I bought this shoe for the Spring/Summer so it would be unfair for me to review it because I have yet to wear it.|3

My husband wore them yesterday,they fit exactly how he wanted.l liked the blue stripe down the middle of the belt.I was skeptical,because you can't be to sure when it comes to Burlington's men's clothing, their clothing look so big.But,it was fine|5
Lightweight great for summer. I like the snaps on the pockets.|4
Wore these for the first time yesterday and was very happy with the look and feel.|4
Super good value! Best value for the money. I may buy more later|5
This is a great sweater for the guy who likes comfort. The lining adds to the warmth of the item, and the pockets are an added bonus for the guy to carry keys.|5
Good price.........................................|4

I had to buy new T-shirts since I lost weight. This one fit the bill.|5
Fits perfect nice and long.no need to iron out the bag. Want more like these|5
Bought some shirts at good prices and the shipping was fast .|4
I should have purchased a medium the large runs alittle big|4
My husband is a solid XL. I even checked the size chart before I bout it and this was way to big on him. More like a 2 or 3 XL. The style is great! Just make sure u buy a size smaller than u need.|3
I don't know how they size, but I've been wearing 3X for many years and when I tried this and two other shirts that I bought in 3X they all fit like they were "Larges". It was impossible to put them on. I'll never buy clothing online. I did return them to a store which was easy, but I still lost my shipping fees. Not fair!|1

Thanks Burlington|5
It was a gift.....too my granddaughter for christmas....|5
My 2 year old got this for his birthday and recognized colors within a few days after playing with this!! Great educational toy!!|5
Great product, good price, nicely assembled, door stays shut, educational|5
I bought this for two if my grandsons. Their cousin has it and loved playing with it.|5
I bought this for a toddler at our church. I was impressed with the way it was displayed, with a clear visual of the pieces.|5
My daughter loves this Minnie play gim. She's having fun!|5
I bought this a month ago and my grandson can't stop playing with this!|5
tHIS CENTER IS IDEAL FOR TODDLERS IT AFFORDS THEM WITH CLIMBING OPPORTUNITIES TO CLIMB AND SLIDE AND ROCK. ITS SPECIAL HEIGHT MAKES IT SAFE SO FALLS WHICH ARE INEVITABLE ARE NOT FROM A DISTANCE, iT IS LIGHT WEIGHT SO IT WILL SUPPORT THE CHILD BUT WILL GIVE WHEN NEEDED|4
My little one loves this. It's great for in doors or out door when weather is nice|5
I was a little sad the set didn't come with a mustard! Haha it has some scratches. Otherwise great product for the price!|4
Bought for my 3 year old nephew. Great size. He loves it.|5
I brought this for my 6 year old grandson for a Christmas gift, he really enjoys playing with it. He likes that it has several different things to do while playing pretend. It seems to be well built. I would recommend it for boys or girls age 3 to 6 years old age range.|4
Was exactly what we expected. Love the moving parts when you use the "key."|4
Not as large as I thought it would be, but my Grandson Loved it. Took a minute to charge and after that he was flying it all over.|4
Basic functions three colors and fun noises for little ones my son will be 2 soon and he loves the things he can move on his own makes a nice addition.|4
The price of this product on Burlington's website is good because it is $30 through other vendors. The packaging causes the vinyl to fold funny, but this isn't Burlington's fault. This is a nice indoor toy for a kid, the balls are soft and the game is easy to set up. It's not a tough toy, so if your kids are rough or older, it may not be a good fit for them. But if you have a kid who likes playing catch or you need a toy to take on a trip, this is a great activity to have on hand.|4
My son loves to have a battle with these and is entertained for hours|4
Fast shipping and great item as a gift for young boy|5
The toggle switch doesn't even go up and down, only side to side, and the plane only goes up sometimes. Huge disappointment!|1
The helicopter we received was well worn. Blades were bent and parts missing.|1
My husband was thrilled and loved it. He can't wait to fly it!|5
My kid loves Octonauts...so even a disappointing toy (such as this one) will get three stars. The air pressure required to 'do' all the fun things is weak. I'd advise not to buy this toy. It will be quickly dismissed because it doesn't work well.|3

Rope should be thicker for little hands to grip better, but it suits it's purpose. Good deal.|2
We were able to get one charge in. Then about a 5 minute flight. Now it wont charge with the controller or via USB. I followed all directions and still nothing. It will sync up with controller, light up, start to spin and then the copter dies. Burlington purchasing department needs to stop buying ultra low quality that makes people angry.|1
This toy did not work. I change batteries and all! Very dissappointed and lost receipt so now i cant get my money back|1
The place where to put the battery in the hand controller, wouldn't open, had to force it with a knife. The to battery was a battle to put in, the space was too small. After all that work, the light on the remote control turns on, but it doesn't make the car move. My 3year old was very disappointed, now I have to get similar toy, but diff place.
I love shopping at Burlington, first time I ever have an item I've purchased.|1

Bought it for my 9 year old daughter, she love it. She loved how it folds and goes right into her purse. There's plenty of makeup.|5
These pans work great for mixing and baking. This product is a steal for the price, and it was shipped in a timely manner. My granddaughter loves it (so does grandma).
Thanks Burlington|5
I was a little sad the set didn't come with a mustard! Haha it has some scratches. Otherwise great product for the price!|4
Bought for my 3 year old nephew. Great size. He loves it.|5
I brought this for my 6 year old grandson for a Christmas gift, he really enjoys playing with it. He likes that it has several different things to do while playing pretend. It seems to be well built. I would recommend it for boys or girls age 3 to 6 years old age range.|4
Was exactly what we expected. Love the moving parts when you use the "key."|4
Basic functions three colors and fun noises for little ones my son will be 2 soon and he loves the things he can move on his own makes a nice addition.|4
My kid loves Octonauts...so even a disappointing toy (such as this one) will get three stars. The air pressure required to 'do' all the fun things is weak. I'd advise not to buy this toy. It will be quickly dismissed because it doesn't work well.|3
The place where to put the battery in the hand controller, wouldn't open, had to force it with a knife. The to battery was a battle to put in, the space was too small. After all that work, the light on the remote control turns on, but it doesn't make the car move. My 3year old was very disappointed, now I have to get similar toy, but diff place.
I love shopping at Burlington, first time I ever have an item I've purchased.|1

Not as large as I thought it would be, but my Grandson Loved it. Took a minute to charge and after that he was flying it all over.|4
My son loves to have a battle with these and is entertained for hours|4
Fast shipping and great item as a gift for young boy|5
The toggle switch doesn't even go up and down, only side to side, and the plane only goes up sometimes. Huge disappointment!|1
The helicopter we received was well worn. Blades were bent and parts missing.|1
My husband was thrilled and loved it. He can't wait to fly it!|5
We were able to get one charge in. Then about a 5 minute flight. Now it wont charge with the controller or via USB. I followed all directions and still nothing. It will sync up with controller, light up, start to spin and then the copter dies. Burlington purchasing department needs to stop buying ultra low quality that makes people angry.|1

Gave this to our grandson for his first birthday. No problems until someone tries to take him out. Then he gets highly upset!|5
Bought this for my nieces wedding in July and can't wait to wear it.|5

tHIS CENTER IS IDEAL FOR TODDLERS IT AFFORDS THEM WITH CLIMBING OPPORTUNITIES TO CLIMB AND SLIDE AND ROCK. ITS SPECIAL HEIGHT MAKES IT SAFE SO FALLS WHICH ARE INEVITABLE ARE NOT FROM A DISTANCE, iT IS LIGHT WEIGHT SO IT WILL SUPPORT THE CHILD BUT WILL GIVE WHEN NEEDED|4
My little one loves this. It's great for in doors or out door when weather is nice|5
Rope should be thicker for little hands to grip better, but it suits it's purpose. Good deal.|2

My 18 mo old got this slide as a Xmas present! He loves it. Perfect size for him. Very happy. Got here very quickly too|5
We cannot believe the quality.
It is heavy so the stools do not tip and the table is large and feels much more expensive than it was. Colors are bright and fun. There is truly no other set like this one.
I love this company called LOLLY&ME.....They seem to really get design and value.|5
I bought this for two if my grandsons. Their cousin has it and loved playing with it.|5

The price of this product on Burlington's website is good because it is $30 through other vendors. The packaging causes the vinyl to fold funny, but this isn't Burlington's fault. This is a nice indoor toy for a kid, the balls are soft and the game is easy to set up. It's not a tough toy, so if your kids are rough or older, it may not be a good fit for them. But if you have a kid who likes playing catch or you need a toy to take on a trip, this is a great activity to have on hand.|4

its ok not that much....the child seat is too small..fit only below 7 month old babies only...|2

I bought this a month ago and my grandson can't stop playing with this!|5
This is a Christmas gift. Looks like all my grandchildren can play together while staying with us. Will see, next year they'll range from one year to six years. Great gift! doesn't look like its too messy either.|5

I was looking for this toy box on line and found that Burlington had the best deal. Before this I wouldn't have thought to look at Burlington. It also arrived in a few days, good shipping. I like that the toy box has small drawers on the bottom. Just right for Legos.|5
It holds a lot of toys and is very sturdy. It fits nicely in our living room.|5
Love it!!! Very spacious for lots of toys (large and small) and I like the bottom bins for the little toys. Happy that they are just under it and not attached it makes it easier for the kids to put away. Used by two rambunctious two year old boys.|5
The toy chest was a bit warped but I got it together and I think it will do just fine. I'm excited that my daughter will be able to enjoy this for a very long time.|4

This bookshelf is very well made and just beautiful. It looks hand-picked and hand-carved. For the price it is a great deal. The shelves are wide and strong. The drawer below is a nice feature. The only thing I wish the drawer had were tracks because it just goes in the slot with no tracks.|5
It doesn't take up to much room. I'm very pleased with this|5

Everything about the chair we purchased met or exceeded our expectations. It has the appearance of regular furniture but sized for a child. Our granddaughter loves it.|5
A great buy. I bought one for my son in store and 2 more this Christmas for my nephews. They love it. It is the perfect size for a toddler. I just wish they had more color options|5
My 18 mo old got this slide as a Xmas present! He loves it. Perfect size for him. Very happy. Got here very quickly too|5

We bought this for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday. Her favorite color is yellow and she loves animals. She loved the rocking chair and immediately sat in it when she saw it with a huge smile! As the day went on, she was rocking her baby dolls and stuffed teddy bears.
This was easy to assemble and very durable for younger children.|5

My granddaughter lovesi t. She watches TV. on it and just sits on the chair. It is everything I was expecting.|5
I ordered this for my granddaughter to put in my parents house so she would have her "own chair". We all love it so much that I ordered another one for my house.|5
I bought this chair for my son and he absolutely loves it! This is a great chair for a great price!!|5
I purchased the rocking chairs for Christmas presents for my twin grandsons because they are low to the floor and I had bought one years ago for my other grandson and he loved it and used it everyday up to until he turned 6. I hope they get as much use out of them also.|5
I purchased this desk for my 10 year old grandson because of the bookcase feature and it was a great solution for his smallish bedroom. The desk fits him perfectly and the bookcase holds the books he is interested in now. It won't accommodate every book he owns but it is adequate for what he is reading now and has read recently. It was easy to assemble and seems to be sturdy. Excellent choice for his room.|5

I love this table and chair set in my daughter's room, it is so lovely in white and seems really strong. It's a great size, not too big and not too small. She is almost 2 and loves to sit and color and have tea parties on it and I expect it will last well for many years.|5
Bought about a week ago still standing strong. Daughter loves it.|5
I was very pleased with the chair that I purchased! The price was right and the chair was more then what I expected! It just right for the little children. Thank you! I hope to purchase another one in the near future.|5
It shipped quickly and it was exactly what I was looking for. You can't beat the price and I'm so excited to give it to my 1 year old for Christmas. It's the perfect size.|5
This was better quality than I thought it would be for the money granddaughter loved it|5
Darling fabric--pink gingham--seems sturdy, wood legs, good sise for a 1-3 yr old. Only thing that should be different is to have a sturdy backing underneath the fabric in the back-- could puncture easily through fabric.|4
I bought this chair upholstered in denim for my 18 mo old daughter for Christmas. I am very impressed with the quality if material. The denim is a heavy weight dark indigo. It reads more modern and less country (which we like.) The upholstery is tight. No wrinkles. The foam is firm and smooth. The construction is sturdy. The price is a bonus too! The best value around!|4
I bought this chair for my Grandson for Christmas. I could not believe the quality of this chair for the price I paid. It is very well built, looks like I paid much more for it and my Grandson loves it!|5
This chair is everything it says it is. Very nice construction - material is nice and taut on the chair. Can't wait to give it to my nephew for Christmas - he will love it.|5
Love this chair. Very sturdy. My 2 year old loves to kick back in it|5
Super cute and great construction!!! Can't wait to give it to my granddaughter!!!|5
It really looks pretty cheaply made and there are several flaws|3
This sofa is great, so comfy, cute, affordable my daughter loves it!|5
I Bought this for my 1 year old grandson for Christmas. It is adorable. I know he will love it.|5
The denim does rub off onto the wall and it's not really stain resistant like description says. So we will just scotch guard them and keep them away from wall when in use. Very cute and sturdy frame and my boys 2 & 4 love them|4
It gets dirty pretty fast but my daughter now enjoys getting in and out of it.|5
Christmas present for our Grandaughter....Loved it!|4
The toy chest was a bit warped but I got it together and I think it will do just fine. I'm excited that my daughter will be able to enjoy this for a very long time.|4

I got this for great nephew, and he loves it. Will have to see how it stands up to wear and tear.|4
My husband and I bought this for Christmas for our two girls (2 and 4). Putting it together would have been very easy except for a couple of problems. First, you have to be very careful not to tighten the wood screws that go in the top of the chair back very much. It will split the wood. You can't even get them hand tight. Just enough to hold the pieces together with no gap is all you can do or it starts to crack a little.|4
I bought this for my 19 month old daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it and I do too! It's a great size because she can use it now but there is still plenty of room for her to grow and use for a long time to come. She is in it all the time so my mom bought one to keep at her house for my daughter to use when she's over there.|5
I love this little chair. It's adorable. It is actually a bit bigger than I expected which is nice.|5
Did not receive email product had shipped. Took over 2 weeks to receive. Product is hard to clean. Will not be returning to shop there.|1
This is a christmas but I know my grand daughter will love it .It is really cute...|4
My 19 month old daughter received this for Christmas and it's been used daily. This past week, the cushion on the seat has shifted over so a wood support piece is basically exposed and when she sits down, it's right under her. Very disappointed in how long this item lasted.|1
Our son absolutely loves his chair. Only problem we had was it was supposed to be in brown and we got blue, but that was not a big deal. They were very kind and took 10% off to make it better.|5
We bought this chair for a oresent for our 1 year old granddaughter. Cant wait to givd to her. She ttie one out when she sees one in the stores.|5
this is the 3rd chair we purchased, all for one year olds' birthdays!! This chair is so adorable and very light weight, and the kids fit in them just perfect!!!|4
Bought this for a Christmas Present for my daughter. We went away for Christmas so she has literally used it for a week. It already has a small tear it in. Disappointed in the quality of the fabric. My 17 month old loves it though. So we will hold onto it until it totally falls apart.|3
When we purchased this, we didn't realize how small it was. My 10 year old daughter bought it for her pink bedroom but there is no way she can sit in it. We gave it to my niece. It's adorable - but definitely for smaller children.|3
I bought this stepstool a couple weeks ago. Came completely disassembled, which was fine. Picture instructions were clear and all parts were there. However, there were two design flaws. One, the inner box floor is extremely thin and could easily be broken with anything remotely heavy stored inside. Secondly, the final pre-drilled holes for the hinges on the lid were not deep enough, and by the time I realized it, I had already stripped the screws. Haven't got around yet to going to the hardware store to buy new screws, drill better holes and re attach lid -- so a bit disappointed. Stool is smaller in width than I expected (I should have done a measurement comparison to older stepstool. The hardwood seems of good quality, the only complaint re the wood I have is the very thin plywood storage box floor.|3
This product was made with very poor quality, i was very disappointed in how poorly it was constructed. If I would of have time , to replace , would of returned and ordered elsewhere, quality was that bad, !!!!!!!!|1
This chair and ottoman is so cute. It's more pink than lavender in person ~ yet adorable|4
I bought this for my adult children. Thinking it was for adults, not children. Not the case!! Disgusted I wasted $89 because they refuse to return it!!|1

Great toys for bathtime............................|5
I bought this for two if my grandsons. Their cousin has it and loved playing with it.|5
The price of this product on Burlington's website is good because it is $30 through other vendors. The packaging causes the vinyl to fold funny, but this isn't Burlington's fault. This is a nice indoor toy for a kid, the balls are soft and the game is easy to set up. It's not a tough toy, so if your kids are rough or older, it may not be a good fit for them. But if you have a kid who likes playing catch or you need a toy to take on a trip, this is a great activity to have on hand.|4
Matches the theme of my nursery and love the battery included addition of the rotating music box that spins. Great feature and worth every penny.|5

This is a Christmas gift. Looks like all my grandchildren can play together while staying with us. Will see, next year they'll range from one year to six years. Great gift! doesn't look like its too messy either.|5
Not as large as I thought it would be, but my Grandson Loved it. Took a minute to charge and after that he was flying it all over.|4
