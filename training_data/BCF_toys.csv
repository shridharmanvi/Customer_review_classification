I bought this for Christmas for my grandson and he LOVED it! He even took it to bed with him. A lot of fun for a 5 year old.You can't go wrong if you buy this toy.|5

Gave this to our grandson for his first birthday. No problems until someone tries to take him out. Then he gets highly upset!|5
Bought this for my nieces wedding in July and can't wait to wear it.|5
I haven't put my baby in it yet but I'm sure she will love it!|5

This is a Christmas gift. Looks like all my grandchildren can play together while staying with us. Will see, next year they'll range from one year to six years. Great gift! doesn't look like its too messy either.|5
Bought this for my 2 month old nephew for Christmas and he loves it! So cute and interactice.|5
Bought it for my 9 year old daughter, she love it. She loved how it folds and goes right into her purse. There's plenty of makeup.|5
Great toys for bathtime............................|5
These pans work great for mixing and baking. This product is a steal for the price, and it was shipped in a timely manner. My granddaughter loves it (so does grandma).
Thanks Burlington|5
It was a gift.....too my granddaughter for christmas....|5
My 2 year old got this for his birthday and recognized colors within a few days after playing with this!! Great educational toy!!|5
Great product, good price, nicely assembled, door stays shut, educational|5
I bought this for two if my grandsons. Their cousin has it and loved playing with it.|5
I bought this for a toddler at our church. I was impressed with the way it was displayed, with a clear visual of the pieces.|5
My daughter loves this Minnie play gim. She's having fun!|5
I bought this a month ago and my grandson can't stop playing with this!|5
tHIS CENTER IS IDEAL FOR TODDLERS IT AFFORDS THEM WITH CLIMBING OPPORTUNITIES TO CLIMB AND SLIDE AND ROCK. ITS SPECIAL HEIGHT MAKES IT SAFE SO FALLS WHICH ARE INEVITABLE ARE NOT FROM A DISTANCE, iT IS LIGHT WEIGHT SO IT WILL SUPPORT THE CHILD BUT WILL GIVE WHEN NEEDED|4
My little one loves this. It's great for in doors or out door when weather is nice|5
I was a little sad the set didn't come with a mustard! Haha it has some scratches. Otherwise great product for the price!|4
Bought for my 3 year old nephew. Great size. He loves it.|5
I brought this for my 6 year old grandson for a Christmas gift, he really enjoys playing with it. He likes that it has several different things to do while playing pretend. It seems to be well built. I would recommend it for boys or girls age 3 to 6 years old age range.|4
Was exactly what we expected. Love the moving parts when you use the "key."|4
Not as large as I thought it would be, but my Grandson Loved it. Took a minute to charge and after that he was flying it all over.|4
Basic functions three colors and fun noises for little ones my son will be 2 soon and he loves the things he can move on his own makes a nice addition.|4
The price of this product on Burlington's website is good because it is $30 through other vendors. The packaging causes the vinyl to fold funny, but this isn't Burlington's fault. This is a nice indoor toy for a kid, the balls are soft and the game is easy to set up. It's not a tough toy, so if your kids are rough or older, it may not be a good fit for them. But if you have a kid who likes playing catch or you need a toy to take on a trip, this is a great activity to have on hand.|4
My son loves to have a battle with these and is entertained for hours|4
Fast shipping and great item as a gift for young boy|5
The toggle switch doesn't even go up and down, only side to side, and the plane only goes up sometimes. Huge disappointment!|1
The helicopter we received was well worn. Blades were bent and parts missing.|1
My husband was thrilled and loved it. He can't wait to fly it!|5
My kid loves Octonauts...so even a disappointing toy (such as this one) will get three stars. The air pressure required to 'do' all the fun things is weak. I'd advise not to buy this toy. It will be quickly dismissed because it doesn't work well.|3

Rope should be thicker for little hands to grip better, but it suits it's purpose. Good deal.|2
We were able to get one charge in. Then about a 5 minute flight. Now it wont charge with the controller or via USB. I followed all directions and still nothing. It will sync up with controller, light up, start to spin and then the copter dies. Burlington purchasing department needs to stop buying ultra low quality that makes people angry.|1
This toy did not work. I change batteries and all! Very dissappointed and lost receipt so now i cant get my money back|1
The place where to put the battery in the hand controller, wouldn't open, had to force it with a knife. The to battery was a battle to put in, the space was too small. After all that work, the light on the remote control turns on, but it doesn't make the car move. My 3year old was very disappointed, now I have to get similar toy, but diff place.
I love shopping at Burlington, first time I ever have an item I've purchased.|1

We cannot believe the quality.
It is heavy so the stools do not tip and the table is large and feels much more expensive than it was. Colors are bright and fun. There is truly no other set like this one.
I love this company called LOLLY&ME.....They seem to really get design and value.|5
I bought this for two if my grandsons. Their cousin has it and loved playing with it.|5

I bought this two days ago and it is already at my home ready to be wrapped for my son's 3rd Christmas! It was quite possibly the fastest shipping I have ever gotten from a company and best of all, THE SHIPPING WAS FREE! Usually you have to pay extra for that kind of service! The item arrived in perfect working condition without so much as a scratch! I would highly recommend buying this or any product from their site for that matter! Thank you Burlington Coat Factory!|5

I bought this two days ago and it is already at my home ready to be wrapped for my son's 3rd Christmas! It was quite possibly the fastest shipping I have ever gotten from a company and best of all, THE SHIPPING WAS FREE! Usually you have to pay extra for that kind of service! The item arrived in perfect working condition without so much as a scratch! I would highly recommend buying this or any product from their site for that matter! Thank you Burlington Coat Factory!|5
Basic functions three colors and fun noises for little ones my son will be 2 soon and he loves the things he can move on his own makes a nice addition.|4
I was looking for this toy box on line and found that Burlington had the best deal. Before this I wouldn't have thought to look at Burlington. It also arrived in a few days, good shipping. I like that the toy box has small drawers on the bottom. Just right for Legos.|5
It holds a lot of toys and is very sturdy. It fits nicely in our living room.|5
Love it!!! Very spacious for lots of toys (large and small) and I like the bottom bins for the little toys. Happy that they are just under it and not attached it makes it easier for the kids to put away. Used by two rambunctious two year old boys.|5
The toy chest was a bit warped but I got it together and I think it will do just fine. I'm excited that my daughter will be able to enjoy this for a very long time.|4

Yes it holds bath tiys but they must be really small in order for the bag to stay on the wall.|3
This bookshelf is very well made and just beautiful. It looks hand-picked and hand-carved. For the price it is a great deal. The shelves are wide and strong. The drawer below is a nice feature. The only thing I wish the drawer had were tracks because it just goes in the slot with no tracks.|5
It doesn't take up to much room. I'm very pleased with this|5

Everything about the chair we purchased met or exceeded our expectations. It has the appearance of regular furniture but sized for a child. Our granddaughter loves it.|5
A great buy. I bought one for my son in store and 2 more this Christmas for my nephews. They love it. It is the perfect size for a toddler. I just wish they had more color options|5
My 18 mo old got this slide as a Xmas present! He loves it. Perfect size for him. Very happy. Got here very quickly too|5
I bought this just before Christmas, didn't expect it to arrive until after Christmas. Arrived Christmas Eve. Just in time. Loved the service.|5

We bought this for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday. Her favorite color is yellow and she loves animals. She loved the rocking chair and immediately sat in it when she saw it with a huge smile! As the day went on, she was rocking her baby dolls and stuffed teddy bears.
This was easy to assemble and very durable for younger children.|5

I bought this for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday...she loves it and I love it....very sturdy and made so well....so beautiful.....very happy with this purchase....|5
My granddaughter lovesi t. She watches TV. on it and just sits on the chair. It is everything I was expecting.|5
I ordered this for my granddaughter to put in my parents house so she would have her "own chair". We all love it so much that I ordered another one for my house.|5
I bought this chair for my son and he absolutely loves it! This is a great chair for a great price!!|5
I purchased the rocking chairs for Christmas presents for my twin grandsons because they are low to the floor and I had bought one years ago for my other grandson and he loved it and used it everyday up to until he turned 6. I hope they get as much use out of them also.|5
I purchased this desk for my 10 year old grandson because of the bookcase feature and it was a great solution for his smallish bedroom. The desk fits him perfectly and the bookcase holds the books he is interested in now. It won't accommodate every book he owns but it is adequate for what he is reading now and has read recently. It was easy to assemble and seems to be sturdy. Excellent choice for his room.|5

I love this table and chair set in my daughter's room, it is so lovely in white and seems really strong. It's a great size, not too big and not too small. She is almost 2 and loves to sit and color and have tea parties on it and I expect it will last well for many years.|5
Bought about a week ago still standing strong. Daughter loves it.|5
I was very pleased with the chair that I purchased! The price was right and the chair was more then what I expected! It just right for the little children. Thank you! I hope to purchase another one in the near future.|5
It shipped quickly and it was exactly what I was looking for. You can't beat the price and I'm so excited to give it to my 1 year old for Christmas. It's the perfect size.|5
This was better quality than I thought it would be for the money granddaughter loved it|5
Darling fabric--pink gingham--seems sturdy, wood legs, good sise for a 1-3 yr old. Only thing that should be different is to have a sturdy backing underneath the fabric in the back-- could puncture easily through fabric.|4
I bought this chair upholstered in denim for my 18 mo old daughter for Christmas. I am very impressed with the quality if material. The denim is a heavy weight dark indigo. It reads more modern and less country (which we like.) The upholstery is tight. No wrinkles. The foam is firm and smooth. The construction is sturdy. The price is a bonus too! The best value around!|4
I bought this chair for my Grandson for Christmas. I could not believe the quality of this chair for the price I paid. It is very well built, looks like I paid much more for it and my Grandson loves it!|5
This chair is everything it says it is. Very nice construction - material is nice and taut on the chair. Can't wait to give it to my nephew for Christmas - he will love it.|5
Love this chair. Very sturdy. My 2 year old loves to kick back in it|5
Super cute and great construction!!! Can't wait to give it to my granddaughter!!!|5
It really looks pretty cheaply made and there are several flaws|3
This sofa is great, so comfy, cute, affordable my daughter loves it!|5
I Bought this for my 1 year old grandson for Christmas. It is adorable. I know he will love it.|5
The denim does rub off onto the wall and it's not really stain resistant like description says. So we will just scotch guard them and keep them away from wall when in use. Very cute and sturdy frame and my boys 2 & 4 love them|4
It gets dirty pretty fast but my daughter now enjoys getting in and out of it.|5
Christmas present for our Grandaughter....Loved it!|4

I got this for great nephew, and he loves it. Will have to see how it stands up to wear and tear.|4
My husband and I bought this for Christmas for our two girls (2 and 4). Putting it together would have been very easy except for a couple of problems. First, you have to be very careful not to tighten the wood screws that go in the top of the chair back very much. It will split the wood. You can't even get them hand tight. Just enough to hold the pieces together with no gap is all you can do or it starts to crack a little.|4
I bought this for my 19 month old daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it and I do too! It's a great size because she can use it now but there is still plenty of room for her to grow and use for a long time to come. She is in it all the time so my mom bought one to keep at her house for my daughter to use when she's over there.|5
I love this little chair. It's adorable. It is actually a bit bigger than I expected which is nice.|5
Did not receive email product had shipped. Took over 2 weeks to receive. Product is hard to clean. Will not be returning to shop there.|1
This is a christmas but I know my grand daughter will love it .It is really cute...|4
My 19 month old daughter received this for Christmas and it's been used daily. This past week, the cushion on the seat has shifted over so a wood support piece is basically exposed and when she sits down, it's right under her. Very disappointed in how long this item lasted.|1
Our son absolutely loves his chair. Only problem we had was it was supposed to be in brown and we got blue, but that was not a big deal. They were very kind and took 10% off to make it better.|5
We bought this chair for a oresent for our 1 year old granddaughter. Cant wait to givd to her. She ttie one out when she sees one in the stores.|5
this is the 3rd chair we purchased, all for one year olds' birthdays!! This chair is so adorable and very light weight, and the kids fit in them just perfect!!!|4
Bought this for a Christmas Present for my daughter. We went away for Christmas so she has literally used it for a week. It already has a small tear it in. Disappointed in the quality of the fabric. My 17 month old loves it though. So we will hold onto it until it totally falls apart.|3
When we purchased this, we didn't realize how small it was. My 10 year old daughter bought it for her pink bedroom but there is no way she can sit in it. We gave it to my niece. It's adorable - but definitely for smaller children.|3
I bought this stepstool a couple weeks ago. Came completely disassembled, which was fine. Picture instructions were clear and all parts were there. However, there were two design flaws. One, the inner box floor is extremely thin and could easily be broken with anything remotely heavy stored inside. Secondly, the final pre-drilled holes for the hinges on the lid were not deep enough, and by the time I realized it, I had already stripped the screws. Haven't got around yet to going to the hardware store to buy new screws, drill better holes and re attach lid -- so a bit disappointed. Stool is smaller in width than I expected (I should have done a measurement comparison to older stepstool. The hardwood seems of good quality, the only complaint re the wood I have is the very thin plywood storage box floor.|3
This product was made with very poor quality, i was very disappointed in how poorly it was constructed. If I would of have time , to replace , would of returned and ordered elsewhere, quality was that bad, !!!!!!!!|1
This chair and ottoman is so cute. It's more pink than lavender in person ~ yet adorable|4
I bought this for my adult children. Thinking it was for adults, not children. Not the case!! Disgusted I wasted $89 because they refuse to return it!!|1

I bought this for two if my grandsons. Their cousin has it and loved playing with it.|5
The price of this product on Burlington's website is good because it is $30 through other vendors. The packaging causes the vinyl to fold funny, but this isn't Burlington's fault. This is a nice indoor toy for a kid, the balls are soft and the game is easy to set up. It's not a tough toy, so if your kids are rough or older, it may not be a good fit for them. But if you have a kid who likes playing catch or you need a toy to take on a trip, this is a great activity to have on hand.|4

This is a Christmas gift. Looks like all my grandchildren can play together while staying with us. Will see, next year they'll range from one year to six years. Great gift! doesn't look like its too messy either.|5
Not as large as I thought it would be, but my Grandson Loved it. Took a minute to charge and after that he was flying it all over.|4
