The socks are terrific and fit perfectly. I'm glad I purchased two packs. The multiple colors go well with different colored outfits. Less sweaty feet while exercising.|5
I very happy with my slippers. The are very soft and comfortable.|5
My daughter and i both love it. The sz is great with braids and warm enough for the cold too. It has become her college staple head gear. Got it in grey went back for the brown and there was no more :-). heart broken|5
I needed a new hat. I love it. The button sits it off.|5
I was pleased with the fit and comfort of the belt.|5
I purchased this curling iron for myself for Christmas. It was wrapped and under the tree, but I was so excited to try it, I opened it before Christmas. It was a total disappointment. It's very, very hard to use. I'm not a beautician, but I've been curling/styling my hair all my life. I KNOW how to use a curling iron. OH, it did curl my hair. Unfortunately, the curl was wonky, curled the wrong direction and with funky marks on my hair. Also, I did slightly burn my finger once and the palm of my hand as well. No major burns thank goodness. I was also thinking of purchasing this form my 13 year old grand-daughter. I won't after my personal experience with it. I'll be shipping this back very soon.|1
it was a gift. the person did give me feedback. I 'm like, I have wanted to have one like this|3
This was my first time purchasing from Burlington online and I was please with my order|5
Stretchy nice material. Love them! Nice fit. Very comfortable.|5
I purchased these Capris for my teen age niece who is very hard to please. She loved them. Thank you for a great product.|5
Very nice, comfy, and the price is right. Will definitely recommend to a friend!|5
These pants are actually butt-lifting! Tgey are true to size! These pants are comfortable as well!|5
These pants are true to size and accentuate your hips!|5
I RECEIVED THE PANTS A WEEK AGO. THEY FIT PERFECTLY. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK IN SATISFACTION TO YOUR CUSTOMERS!|5
Love the higher waist, very comfortable, and love the slight flare leg.|5
However I don't wear capri's and these are a short ankle style. They fit so good though I'm going to make them work for spring. (or boots) My legs are VERY slim, at 5'10" and 125# so most skinny jeans/jeggings are still baggy. These fit GREAT!!!|5
I ordered these jeans online and I am very pleased with the fit. I wish I could get this same jean in different colors. I am short with hips and this pair of pants fit perfect and are comfortable.|5
I bought them and I hate taking them off to wash I love them. their my fav pair of jeans|5
Never seen my daughter so happy says "I hooked her up"|5
I just bought these, and they are very comfortable. Very pleased with my purchase.|5
As a plus size woman, it was great to find a pair of fashionable pants that fit right and slimmed at the same time. It was great to discover the conversion chart for women's size to Junior's Plus. As a lot of women's plus size clothes are not in fashion with today's style, its good to know a variety of options is available to me by using the conversion chart and purchasing Junior's plus size items.|5
I brought these over a month ago I believe. I haven't actually worn them out but I did try them on .. Perfect fit and what I was looking for... comfortable and affordable|5
I purchased both the blush tone and the khaki color... they not only look & feel great... the quality is better than I anticipated!!!|5
When I saw these the pastel color said spring. Love the fit and feel. Would love to have a pair in pale blue.|4
I haven't worn since purchase. I'm debating on whether to return or keep. I thought these were regular active pants, but after receipt the merchandise tag listed as sleepwear. The color is great because they remind me of summer.|4
I bought them for my daughters but I bought one for myself earlier. It fits well and the quality is good|4
Misread description ... Hipster, but didn't think the crotch would be that uncomfortable! Way too low, not for me. The seams in front were not where most seams feel. Gotta return.|3
The lining is really nice to the skin, much warming than I thought on a winding day, and the arm length is what I needed.|5
The silk lining she likes
The color combo she loves
Durable zipper / snaps
Thick
Affordable|5
I bought this as a gift for my cousin. She's about 85 pounds and 5 feet tall. The arms are a little long but she loves it. It's very soft and thick so it makes for a good winter coat without being too bulky.|5
Great value and beautiful style! My daughter loves it...|5
I bought this jacket, because I was wanted a spring jacket. I am 22 and more on the petite side so when looking at the woman's jacket, I could already invision myslef drowning, ha. So I decided to take a look at the Junior jackets, and they looked perfect the sizing chart also helped a bunch. I got the jacket in a small and I still have room. It's a light jacket with a nice lining, so it keeps you warm but it's not overbearing, but it's also so fashionable. I have received ma y compliments and one of the girls said she likes it so much she wants one for herself. The color is an olive and different from those army green jackets I see everywhere, my favorite feature is the drawstring :) You should purchase this jacket you'll be glad you did.|5
Right color of red and I love the way it fit. Thanks|5
Bought it for my daughter for a spring jacket as well as part of her "Paddington" costume for Book day at school. She won first place for her costume and she loves the jacket and wears it daily now! Only drawback, jacket is navy blue and cotton, so it collects every white dog hair in our house..... lint roller takes care of that just fine, though.|5
I bought this a couple of weeks ago. Very nice fabric|5
This coat is nice and warm, the fur around the hood really keeps the wind and cold out. This particular garment tends to run small and I could have gone with a size bigger, which is something to keep in mind. The price was very reasonable and I am very glad I bought it.|5
purchased this jacket an gave it to my grand daughter, she loves it!|5
I got a great deal on this coat and I love it so much!|5
I bouth this jacket for my daughter and she loved nice and warm.|5
Bought for a Christmas gift, it was a big hit! Every girl there wanted one!!|5
my wife loves the coat. it made me feel good to see her smile.|5
I ordered it online and was happy when I got it because it fit perfectly. It keeps me warm and it has a hood in case it rains, an added bonus. I like that it has a zipper and I like the color.|5
This jacket feels amazing. It keeps me very warm, it's very good for the cold weather|5
I bought these Items about an month ago and everything fits perfect*********|5
I needed a lightwright coat suitable for outside bus duty and my winter coat is too heavy now. This coat fits perfectly, is long enough for being covered in the rain, and has a hood. My daughter said she really liked it too! I bought it in Navy-size small. I wear a 6 in ladies and am 5' 5". At this price, I can get another!|5
Wasnt expecting it to fit me ..but it did! and it looks awesome! mine is Green-Military. Light not heavy. Good shipping and fast! Recommend it!|5
I ordered this jacket in black and I love it. It's very stylish and you can't beat the price. I ordered a small and it fits great.|5
Very well made and the length is good. Lots of pockets for when you're traveling. Runs small so order a size up.|5
This jacket is trendy and is a great length. The only thing is that the hood comes too far over the eyes when the hood is on, but other than that the jacket fits well and is light weight.|4
Love the fabric and design, too bad I didn't pay special attention to the Junior size, got a 2XL but still too small.|5
Purchased this jacket in black and its perfect for this Houston bipolar weather!!|5
It looks perfect on me. Whenever I wear it, people keep asking me where I got it|5
I thought that it would be too small since it was Jr. Plus. And I would've had to take it to the store for an exchange. But it fitted perfect. With a little more room to spare.|5
I brought this coat a month ago and I absolutely love it...I recommend anyone to purchase this coat|5
I purchased a size 2X online so I'd have enough room to wear sweaters or layers but coat fitted too large so I returned it to the store which was a smooth process hoping to get a smaller size but it wasn't available. However, the coat was nice looking and would of kept me warm.|4
This coat is super warm and lightweight. I'm glad I bought it. Fits perfectly. I'm a busty woman & I have no problems with zipping.|5
I wish that I would have purchased it in black too. This coat is super light and super warm. I LOVE the holes in the sleeve for my thumb.|5
I just got my jacket a week ago and I love the way it looks on me|5
I bought a coat about a month ago - good purchase.|4
Got the medium size and it just fits right. Im petite 5'0 $130lbs. Love the style especially the price. If you want room for thick shirt or sweater get the Large. I live in a state where its no cold all the time. So I only use light shirt underneath.|5
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it, but beware - it runs a little small.|4
This is a very nice looking jacket, I wish I could have fit in it. Very stylish|5
I just bought this tonight in store
omg so very warm|5
Purchased online and am very happy with the fit and look. I only wish I qualified for the free shipping.|4
I bought this for myself a couple of weeks ago. I love it, however it runs very small.|4
I brought this a few weeks ago it's warm and I liked the style of it.that shipping was great to with a few days I received my product love it..I got it at a reasonable price too|4
I bought this coat last week just before it got cold. Perfect to wear now, kept me warm and comfortable.|5
It's soo comfortable, and very warm. I received a lot of compliments about it|5
Bought the cost but I had to send it back to small.|3
Roomy and adjustable, this cute rain slicker is a must! The fit is true to size and has ability to cinch at the waist if you want a more form flattering silhouette. The only disappointments were the false top pockets and dummy zippers. The pockets below the waist are deep and can easily stash a large cellphone like the note 4 or 6 plus.|4
I ordered this a few weeks ago for a weekend getaway when I found out it might be rainy. It came within a few days, it fit perfectly (I just went by the size guide in the website, taking measurements) and is even more attractive in person. It was good for rainy and windy conditions. Great find for such a reasonable price!|5
I bought this jacket, but i wish the jackets top pockets were actual pockets|3
when this coat arrived, i was not impressed with it in the package, but once I put it on, I was so happy I bought it. it is all about the fit with this coat and it is very complimentary|5
Nice coat, shipped promptly but sadly was too small. Seemed to run a bit small.|3
I bought this jacket about a month ago! It has been pretty good so far.|4
Great size shape and color. Exactly what I needed and wanted|5
When buying this jacket, it does run super small, I usually wear a medium however I had to buy an extra large for this jacket to fit.|4
I purchase this coat for my daughter. She loves it, however, in my opinion a little on the thin side. The hood fits snug around the face.|4

I bought them for my daughters and theye really love them|4
Warm, cozy, and very fashionable. Bought it for my niece and she loves it! Definitely going back to Burlington !|4
Only had it for a month but satisfied with the outcome.|5
I wish it was a little longer but overall great purchase!!!!!! The fur on the hood is very soft and fits well|5
This coat is ok, but they sewed the fur into the seam on the hood. I wear it sans hood.|3
I ordered this coat last month and it had 5 holes in it and day to day the holes got bigger and bigger the quality of this coat is so cheap it will keep you warm. Alittle but you will not survive and wett weather with thia coat i rate 0|1
I bought this coat two weeks ago for my daughter. I love the color. My daughter loves the coat. It fits her perfectly. I would certainly recommend it to others.|5
Good looking jacket but not quite warm enough even with a sweater underneath. Good for wearing in a car. The collar is warm but the zipper is not covered therefore it's annoying and cold. Also didn't like the strings hanging from the back of the jacket|3
I bought this about a couple of months ago and it fits my 15yr old daughter well!|3
Love the coat, fits perfectly, light weight and not bulky.|5
I saw this jacket in another store and could never find my size and was double the price! Looked on Burlington's website and I find it in my size for $25! I wore it to my works Christmas party and it was a hit!|5
I usually wear a "small" but ordered a "medium" and it was ridiculously small - like for a child. I was so disappointed.|1
When I selected this jacket was looking forward to it cause it has the hoodie come to find out is not women size was sad about it|1
It's a great buy for the quality and cost
I will purchase another one for my other daughter for Christmas mo NJ|5
I thought a Junior large I could wear but I actually need a XL even though bust said 38.5 inches. Loved the jacket probably have daughter try it on before I have to return it to the store. Love the color, the crop length. I usually wear a woman's large.|3
This coat was ok...I purchased the grey one for my daughter who has no problem wearing a Medium Junior size...so we went up to a size large hoping she might be able to wear it next year. This "coat" runs WAY SMALL! The sleeves were 2 inches too short and when she raised her arms the bottom of the coat showed her belly button, and there was no way she was gonna be able to cross her arms if bundled up. We've purchased several coats lately from Burlington and all of them seem to run very small. This will make 2 that I have had to return due to not fitting and it's really just not worth it, I won't be buying from here again. Also, this is more like a heavy jacket...hardly heavy enough to call a coat.|3
This coat runs very small! Now I have to return it!!!|1
I bought this in the size I usually buy that will cover a ladies suit or sweaters. It was so small that it wouldn't even close. It was not available 3 sizes larger or I would have rebought, It was a beautiful, soft coat.|1
I purchased this coat about 2 weeks ago and the coat has now began to show snags and it has busted on the side.I would like to be refunded my money or get anot her coat of my choice...|1
I bought this a month ago and Im so happy that I did.|5
I bought this dress in mint a few weeks ago and I'm so happy that I did! The color is gorgeous and it fits well. I did have to order a size larger than I normally do, though because it is a fit and flare style.|5
It's so comfy and the colors are beautiful!! Couldn't be more please!|5
Very pretty, good quality not cheap looking, very comfortable material.|5
I love my dress ! It looks even better than I thought. It was very inexpensive and looks like it would be an expensive dress. I couldn't be happier. It is for my cousins wedding and is perfect!|5
Simply gorgeous! It's the perfect length and just stunning! Only 'issue' with it, is you'll need to wear a slip underneath, as it's very sheer.|5
The dress is more pretty than I imagined! It looks great contrasted with black! I love it and it was such a good deal!|4
The dress is a nice rose color gold. I thought it was just plain gold sequins, but they had a nice pink tint to them! An added bonus! The dress is a size 3 and is true to size. The cut outs are a nice touch, yet doesn't reveal your bra like many do. The sequins are not scratchy except a little on the bottom. The only con is, some sequins shed a bit, but still in good condition. It came curled up in a tiny package, the only other con, but didn't wrinkle luckily! It goes great with solid black tights and a black cardigan! Great for fancy events!|4
I bought this dress according to the size charts - knowing as a woman, that if ordering a Jr sizing it would likely mean a size or two larger than what I would normally wear. The size chart also indicated that. Unfortunately, the dress arrived today and is definitely women's sizing and is WAY too big - fortunately I can still get it in a smaller size, but having to pay priority shipping to get it again is frustrating when I went out of my way to take measurements and compare it to the chart. Hopefully the second order fits.|4
Great organizer. It's slightly bigger than a regular wallet. You can grab this and run in the store if you don't want to carry your whole purse.|5
Love it the price is great better than other stores|5
I bought this bag for my aunt as a thank you gift and it is more that what I expected, very sturdy and will be ordering one for myself.|5
Beautiful soft leather - just not right size for me. But perfect bag overall|5
It has plenty of room for all the cards money and change.|5
the color is amazing good quality, I love the spaces of the wallet|5
Nice evening bag. Just the right size for the essentials|4
The website said they only had 2 2XL left so I bought this thinking it would be 1-2 sizes too big (typically wear L or XL depending on brand and cut). However, when I received it and tried it on, it definitely fits more like a large than a 2XL. I'm still glad I bought it because they are nice and comfortable but I would definitely purchase a size larger than you think you need.|3
My daughter saw these in one of your stores but they did not have them in her size. I lucked up and found them online. A surprise Christmas present for her!|5
beware i bought these and used the sizing chart and went a size up then intended and the item didnt even go above my knees! waste of money|1
I bouth this jacket for my daughter and she loved nice and warm.|5
I purchased this ring a month ago and I am very pleased with it, It is gorgeous, the picture does not do justice.I recommend this.|5
I'm so happy with this purchase beautiful ring!! Love it, true to size!|5
I love the length, not to long, not too short.....|5
I bought this set of 3 earrings to go on vacation and it was nice that they are 3 totally different looks so I could wear a different pair each night!|5
my granddaughter was looking for something to go with an outfit. this is going to be perfect, can't wait for her to see it.|5
Fast service,quick delivery,easy, just open laptop and easy to see products. Items, when open, are what they looked like when ordered.|5
I bought these earrings for my daughter and they are beautiful!. They are bigger than I expected but nonetheless, very beautiful. Now I need a pair for me :)|5
Exceeded my expectations, simply glamorous bling, bling|5
Absolutely beautiful and comfortable to wear. Love it|5
I purchased these online for my wife, they were very attractive and large hoops as stated , but no where on the pieces was there a sterling silver stamping which gives rise to the possibility that they are not,... unless you see them in the store or absolutely verified as Sterling Silver in the future , I would ask questions.|3
Ring could have at least been in a box or something instead of taped plastic|3
2 pair were the same color, 1 pair was a different color. I have 3 holes in each ear, so it looks funny wearing them all together|3
This item is an exceptional value. However, I cannot wear the hoops; they are way too big.|2
I loved these shoes so much that I bought them in 3 colors! Very cute, and I received many compliments!|5
I bought 2 weeks ago.this boot is amazing and comfortable, I love it.i just looking for buying another one but I can see ..|5
Bought 2 pairs, one for my mom and one for me. We both really liked them.|5
I bought these two weeks ago, I loved them wore them all night and were super comfortable all day, I will re purchase in different color now. I did however buy half a size down.|5
