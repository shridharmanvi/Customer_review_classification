I thought the fabric, colors and style are perfect for Spring into Summertime weather!
My Grandbaby Girl loves this top!|4
I put these on and after one mile of walking they started rippling apart. They are one size bigger than what I wear so it wasn't because the were too small, these are the worst leggings I have ever purchased.|1
This was the best find ever for my daughter. She goes to a private school and needed a rolling backpack for the upcoming school year. I love the everyday prices along with the quality that your getting for your money. They always have great customer service in the stores and very easy experience online. I love Burlington and always find bargains for my family without hurting the bank. Keep it up!|5
I bought this for a cruise that requires an airline flight as well. Has plenty of room, light weight and easily handled by a 3 yr old.|5
Exactly what I wanted. Good quality. Granddaughter will love it.|5

I bought this suitcase for my 4 year old son and he loved it. It's small enough he can carry it himself but large enough to carry a couple suits of clothes and his toys.|5
The luggage was delivered 2 days early and in good condition. The luggage passed with flying colors. Very durable I love it.|5
Bought this for my grandson for a Christmas gift. They are going to Disney in January, It should be great for him!|5
Colors are beautiful and it's a great size for children. We bought it for my 8 year old nephew and he loves it.|5
I bought a small lugagge for my kid. It was an execellent deal!|5
My nephew loved the suitcase, but Burlington needs to do a better job in the packing department. It had a few scratches on the back part of the case. Unfortunately, I opened the box with my nephew and he didn't care about the scratches like I did.|4

I hate when I order an Item and it doesn't look like the picture.
I was worried about that since they offer two designs but it was exactly as shown.
My only critique is the handle should be sturdier considering little children will be pulling at it all the time. My nephew was exciting, thus pulled it around everywhere he went for literally 2 days until I hid it. The handle is kinda shakey now. But overall nice item|5
Bought this for grand daughter 2 1/2 for Christmas, can't wait to give it to her. They are going to Disney in January - she will be so excited to have her own luggage!|5
This Ninja Turtle suitcase was all my 6 year old asked Santa for. He loves it! It came well packaged but there were still some scratches on the top of it. I wanted to try and sneakily send it back for a replacement , but like I said, he loves it. Other than the scratches, which was more of a store issue, the product is sturdy and colorful and pretty spacious.|4
Such a cute roll-on for little ones, great colors and rolls easily. It seems to be a good value but it hasn't been used yet as it's a holiday gift for my 2 yr. old grandbaby|4
The Minnie Mouse Hardside Luggage shipped in the two day period it said it would.
I love it and my granddaughter will love it too!|5
The handle was broken--not so good for a suitcase for anyone, but particularly bad for a three year old who needs to pull it.|1
it's perfect for a short time, my son 4 years old, love it, but it's not durable and poor quality|3

I bought these jeans for my girls early back to school shopping. They are made of a good quality denim and the lace detail is beautiful. These jeans can be paired with a dressy top or a more casual top.|5
This is a nice jean to wear dressy or casual. The detailing on the pockets and around the waist is a nice touch especially for tween girls.|5
Wish they had adjustable waist for children pants or in between sizes|2
What a smart idea, that the hood comes off and the inside polar tech can be woren as a jacket. It's perfect for Arizona weather. From very cold to mild weather.|5
Item matched color and description. Runs a little small but I bought big so all is good!|5
I had been hunting for this very coat for weeks. It was a Christmas gift for my Girl fiends daughter and she was trilled with it.|5
Was very pleased with the quality and looks of the jacket.|5

I bought this for my two year old and it fits perfectly. It appears like it will last at least another winter.|5
A gift for my grand-daughter. Her mom loved it & the price was really good!|5
Fit really nice. My daughter is 5 yrs but shes really skinny and wears 4. So this size 4 fit really good and was long enough for her. She play with the snow, ski and wear the jacket alone with no problem. Warm enough and the water never when thru her cloth. Love it. The hoodie didn't cover her entire head or stood on. But she's too hyper anyway. And i put her a beanie.|5
Purchased this and in less thank 2 weeks it arrived thank you|5
We got this coat for my daughter who is a fashionista and she loves it , mom can wear it when she outgrows it !!!|5

I bought this for my granddaughter and it's exactly what she wanted. When she wears it Christmas Day I hope she likes it.|4
This product was a great value and actually a better quality than what I thought it would be|5
My daughter was lacking a good functional winter coat. I searched online and found nothing with style and wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg. I finally rememembered burlington and I am so glad I did. For less than 15 dollars how could I pass this coat up. Its stylish and the lining inside is so warm! I was very impressed with the material inside and out. My little girl even got compliments from her friends moms and asked where we found it. Definitely a great buy!|5
Purchased for gift...very pleased.
Would purchase again.

I bought this for my grand daughter for Christmas. It's lighter weight than I thought it would be but it's still cute. I bought others for my older grand daughters on another site that were heavier and a better buy than this but they didn't have one in her size.|3
I'm again impressed by the quality of the material and the price was a bargain! My daughter has worn this every day since purchase, if though the weather has been very unusual for December.|4
Vivid red and so cute on... worn to a formal Christmas occasion and received a lot of compliments|5
A very cute coat. It fits my little girl perfectly. The only thing was that it came with a hat instead of a scarf. I ordered the coat in purple. The picture shows the coat in pink with the hat. I bought the coat with the description as saying it came with a scarf. No complaints really...I just thought the writers should know.|5
The coat is cute and fits my daughter well. This did not actually come with a scarf though...only a hat. The hat is cute but I wish the scarf was actually included.|3
Great product and price. I will recommend to friends.|4
It really warm but a bit smaller than I expected. It very nice for it price|4
My daughter really wanted a coat that was a little longer. This one was perfect. It hasn't been super cold yet, but so far she's been warm at the bus stop in the morning.|4
My girl really like it this jacket it's very cute!!!|4
Too small. Not true to size. Will not fit her for only a month or so.|1
This Communion dress is beautiful and so well constructed. The attention to detail is wonderful.|5
I bought this dress to match the bridesmaids dresses in my daughter's wedding! The color is exactly what is shown on the site. However the shiny belt on the front and the shiny skirt of the dress are so much prettier than in the picture! The back has a beautiful big bow that ties. This dress is very pretty and the price is wonderful!|5
I love the color of the dress. Looks just like the picture on the website.|5
Bought this for my 10 yr.old grandaughter. It is well made. She loved the necklace that came with it..I thought the picture on the website was pretty, but it actually is cuter when you see it.In the pic the little sequins look silver, but their coral like the top of the dress..very cute.|5
This is a beautiful, good quality and totally affordable piece. I love it!|5

This dress was even more beautiful in person than on the website.
It sparkles beautifully and moves beautifully when my daughter walks.|5
I bought this 4T dress for Easter. My 3 year old slid right into. It fit perfect! very well made. The inside has a slip. Which makes this dress that much more comfortable. I purchased a hat and shiny black Mary Janes to match with this pretty dress. Now if my daughter would let me put it away. She loves it.|5

I bought this dress to use as a flower girl dress. The color matches perfectly with the bride maids dress.

Size was right on, the only thing is it was a tad shorter than expected and my girl isn't tall at all. Very pretty.|4
I bought this as an Easter dress for my 5 yr old grandaughter who wears a size 6. However, I was very dissapointed, as she was, that the dress is too big. She picked it out and loved it, but, she may not be able to wear it for another year or so.|4

I purchased this as a birthday present for my granddaughter's birthday next month. I really like them they are so cute.|5
Bought these for my 14 year granddaughter for Christmas. She loves them. They are not real heavy jeans, but thicker than leggings. They stretch and fit her beautifully. The size and length are perfect. Bought a 16. If you are really tall they would be short. She is about 5'4 and they are long enough to touch the floor. They have been washed and barely shrunk. So glad I picked these|5
I BOUGHT SEVERAL PAIR FOR MY DAUGHTER, AND SHE LOVES THEM!!!|5
Nice change of pace from leggings and these worked!|5
Hard to find little peeps embroidered jeans. When you are little and your sister is older you want to dress like them. These are so tough and keep their color.|5
My niece is 8 and she cannot stand actual jeans as much as I have tried to buy them for her she just won't wear them. I bought her one pair of these when I was in the store and she ended up loving them! I went online to buy her more because I don't live around a BCF and they had other styles. Can't wait until she gets them Christmas. She'll love all the pairs.|5

Omg I love This so much!!! I wore this one time and it was complemented so much cos of the color and style|5
Bought this in both colors available for my daughter's birthday. She just turned 8, bought a size 10 because she doesn't like swimsuits to fit too tight. They fit her perfect and she loves them both. The skirt seems to slip when she is running around, but probably because it technically is a size too big for her.|5
my daughter loves Minnie and she can't wait to wear this once summer gets here! The fit is great and the suit is really cute!|5
This very cute Crop Denim Vest has just the right touch of decorative treatment! It can be paired with a wide variety of garments so you can get as creative as you want! Really like this one!|5

Item was very pretty but smaller than appeared in photo. Too short. The main reason I bought it was because the length was several inches below the waist. Not so. Very disappointed. I will be returning it.|2
