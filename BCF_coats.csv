Not only is this a beautiful coat, it is also warm. I purchased this for my 83 year old aunt who needed a warm coat that had a nice lining and that she could wear a sweater with; this coat fits the bill. Love it!! Would highly recommend.|5
I bought this a few weeks ago when it wasn't very cold so I didn't wear it. The cold weather set in and it's comfortable, warm, and to my surprise had the thumb hole cutouts in the grey part of the cuff. I won't be cold in this coat. It's one of the few partial down filled coats I could find for the price I paid. Love it!|5
I've been wearing the same coat since 2007, while searching for another option that's just as warm. This coat is a pleasant surprise. I was too hot in it, one cool day. It's fashionable and functional. Love the double zipper and fur-like lining on the wrists and upper back.|5
Very good buy price is right and very warm and love it, you won't be disappointed|5
I like the color. I am a little over 5 feet so it fits long but it's warm.|5
Love love love love it.... what you see is definitely what you get|5
It fits as expected. Will be warm and cozy ! Nice purchase.|5
Coat is super comfortable and warm! And stylish too :)|5
This coat is not bulky but it's warm. The hood can be tightened so if it's very windy it won't blow off your head. Just a great looking and functional cost.|5
I bought this coat about a month ago and I just love it. It is so warm and so very comfortable. It is true to size, it fits great. It really is waterproof and the hood is lined so I don"t have to wear a hat on those cold, cold winter nights. This is by far the best winter coat I have ever owned.|5
i bought this a few weeks ago and i am tremendously pleased. Size is perfect and comfortable. Hood is also great addition to warm lightweight jacket.|5
Really like it. The way it fits glad I got a size bigger.|5
This is a beautiful coat. I sew so am making the hood a collar as i dont like hoods But is is very thick and nice faux fur I am thinking of buying another one at this price|5
My wife has received so many compliments on her coat and it keeps her nice and warm. It looks so rich and like the real thing.|5
I bougth it for my wife and she was very, very happy.|5
I've worn it daily since I got it and love it. Great color and weight!|5
I've been looking for a coat like this for a long time and finally found it at Burlington. Very stylish, comfortable and practical. It can be worn in all seasons. The only thing I would have changed is snaps instead of buttons, as this is a classic raincoat and the buttons will probably fall off before it's worn out!|5
This coat came beautifully packaged. It is lightweight but because of the lining provides warmth as well. You can zip it closed, snap it closed or both. The lining comes out for warmer weather wear. I love coats with hoods. This one can also be detached. Great purchase and nice quality for the reasonable price!|5
Runs large, can't return in store, will keep you warm for sure.|3
This 3 in 1 jacket was exactly what I was looking for. The colors are vibrant, the fit perfect, the materials high quality, and the style versatile to accommodate winter temp ranges. It keeps me toasty warm in the coldest of Minnesota days. Bottom line is that I love it!|5
I needed a good warm jacket and hadn't bought one in years. Hated going to stores. This was perfect. And I can take it apart when the weather is warmer. Great!|5
Great jacket that's has removable inner shell that can be worn. Very warm!|5
Fit great looked great and fair price! Big selection to choose from, price wise as well.|5
Nice looking jacket for any occasion, light enough for summer also|5
I was looking for this coat because I liked it int he other store, but they had only 2 sizes larger. Found in Burlington my size with a great price. But unfortunately it turned too big and I had to return it. Beautiful, lighrweight, but runs large.|5
Happy with coat wished it was available in another color - I would order|5
The lining is really nice to the skin, much warming than I thought on a winding day, and the arm length is what I needed.|5
The silk lining she likes
The color combo she loves
Durable zipper / snaps
Thick
Affordable|5
I bought this rain coat two weeks ago . I absolutely love it . It's so comfy & flexible and soft , unlike other stiff rain coats . The only this is this one doesn't have hood , but to be comfortable is important to me and its fine I just use my umbrella anyway ! Love Love this coat|5
This coat is amazing it fits comfortably, it warm and it looks great.|5
I live in North-western Wisconsin and I bought this jacket for "in-between" weather. It's great for that! It is very stylish, comfortable, and warm. The gathering in the back gives it a nice shape.|5
I shop Burlington all the time so decided to give the on-line catalog a look to see if they had anything different than the store for coats. I bought this one and have to say that I am so pleased with it. It arrived on time and it fits perfectly. It is hard to find something that runs true to size in the arms and length. I love my new coat! PS, it is very warm.|5
I bought this jacket for my mother and she loved it!|5
I ordered this for my daughter in pink. It's a coral/pink and is lovely! The goldtone appliances add the bit of flash that she likes. The cut is extremely flattering (slightly longer tshirt hem in back) as is the extensive seaming and mesh fabric used in the lower quarter of the jacket. First purchase from Burlington.com and SO well worth the price!|5
Very true to size. The coat is large enough to fit 2 sweaters under the coat. The coat looks good to wear. I recommend the coat to anyone. Thank you for having such a good product.|5
First time I ordered from Burlington. Great selection of colors and sizes.|5
I bought this as a gift for my cousin. She's about 85 pounds and 5 feet tall. The arms are a little long but she loves it. It's very soft and thick so it makes for a good winter coat without being too bulky.|5
Great value and beautiful style! My daughter loves it...|5
I purchased this for my 83 year old mother after much online searching. I liked the color and after receiving the item, was impressed with both the fabric and the fit of the garment on her. And best of all, she loved it!|5
I bought this as a gift for an older friend. She loves it. I love it too and I thought it was more for older people. But it complimented me.|5
The only downside is that when I reverse the faux fur to act as lining, the static electricity causes my sweater to pull up!!!!!! Do you have any solution to that?|5
I love this coat ITS BEAUTIFUL True to size and affordable|5
2 weeks ago I bought this jacket and the fit I'd very good. Loving all the pockets and the navy blue is a pleasing color.|5
This coat is not only very warm but also very stylish. Lots of compliments. Only drawback is hood is very roomy and flops down over your face! Size is exact and does not run big as some coats do so measure carefully. Very well made.|5
Bought this jacket for my daughter and it arrived within a week. She was so happy with it and the color is bright and pretty. This jacket is long so the cold doesn't blow up the back and the warm lining with extra elastic on the bottom helps that. Really, this jacket is well made and worth a lot more than I paid.|5
This is an affordable and warm ski jacket with a snow skirt/snow belt inside. This is super important because it stops the snow from entering the jacket. I am excited to use this for my upcoming ski trip.|5
I received it last week, just in time for the cold and windy weather. It's attractive and warm. I'm happy to have purchased it.|5
I purchased this two weeks ago . It came within a week. Really warm and I love it|5
I love this coat, my only regret is I didn't buy the black one too!!|5
Nice medium to lightweight coat, perfect for spring and fall. Fits well, true to size. I am typically a size 8 and a medium fits perfect.|4
I bought this jacket, because I was wanted a spring jacket. I am 22 and more on the petite side so when looking at the woman's jacket, I could already invision myslef drowning, ha. So I decided to take a look at the Junior jackets, and they looked perfect the sizing chart also helped a bunch. I got the jacket in a small and I still have room. It's a light jacket with a nice lining, so it keeps you warm but it's not overbearing, but it's also so fashionable. I have received ma y compliments and one of the girls said she likes it so much she wants one for herself. The color is an olive and different from those army green jackets I see everywhere, my favorite feature is the drawstring :) You should purchase this jacket you'll be glad you did.|5
The jacket was well made and I liked it very much. I had to return the jacket it was to small and was not warm enough for winter.|5
I bought this coat in Med. Petite because I'm in my third trimester and needed to buy a coat that was a size or two up so I can zip it over my expanding belly. I am 5'0" and I normally buy clothes in XS. Regular coats have sleeves that are too long or fall past my knees, but this one fits perfectly. It zips over my belly with enough room to grow, looks professional, and keeps me warm and dry. All in all, a good value.|5
Bought this for my daughter who wants a long zip coat with a snug fit. Feels warm and it's not heavy.|5

Right color of red and I love the way it fit. Thanks|5
This coat is nice and warm, the fur around the hood really keeps the wind and cold out. This particular garment tends to run small and I could have gone with a size bigger, which is something to keep in mind. The price was very reasonable and I am very glad I bought it.|5
Bought this coat a month ago, it is a beautiful coat, well made. It is a fitted style coat Great price for the coat. Would recommend.|5
purchased this jacket an gave it to my grand daughter, she loves it!|5
Bought it for my daughter for a spring jacket as well as part of her "Paddington" costume for Book day at school. She won first place for her costume and she loves the jacket and wears it daily now! Only drawback, jacket is navy blue and cotton, so it collects every white dog hair in our house..... lint roller takes care of that just fine, though.|5
I just brought this....last week.....got to get a longer trench next month|5
Super color, good quality, fits grate.I like my jacket a lot|5
This is a compliment-grabbing coat. I bought it in black. The fabric is conforming and wipe-able. The collar turns up in the inclement weather and it has a front zipper as well as snaps. The back has an elastic internal belt at the waist. The lining to the sleeves is a breathable fabric. There are elasticized cuffs with thumb holes. The local Ski-shop staff love the look and the fabric for spring skiing! There are small epaulets on the shoulder, with silver colored buttons and zips on the pockets. It is perfect for the cool weather currently in the Northeast. (Dec 2015). I'm a standard 10 and got a medium, it fits as I wanted, snugly.|5
This is a great fitting coat and feels comfortable with layers underneath as well. The hidden pockets are a great feature along with the tie belt that gives a slimming appearance. This coat is fully lined and it is the perfect weight. I like the length just above the knees.|5
I love the fit of this coat and it is so comfortable!! Love Love Love|5
Good quality ...true to size im 5'4 140lbs I got an medium and I could have got a small ..but I prefer extra space to layer...nicely insulated ....drawstring around waist are inside for a cleaner look ..overall really happy with what I got especially for the price nice winter coat and late fall in new york...I wore in mid 50s on a windy day nd felt no air go through nice and long pockets in right place 2 thumbs up|5
I bought this a couple of weeks ago. Very nice fabric|5
This coat is exactly what I was looking for; not too light-weight but warm and the fit is just right.|5
I bought this coat to replace one that I had that was similar, it's the right weight is not too heavy it's not too light I love the fit! The size was perfect the hood is a little loose like sort of open but I love it|5
I needed a coat to wear when dressed up in the wintertime. Because of an unusually mild winter, I've not yet needed it but am glad to have it for future wear.|5
I love this rain jacket! So cute and I can't wait to get to use it!|5
I bought this coat and I love the way it fits and feels. The color is nice too!|5
It's the best place to buy excelente stuff and Pay very cheap!|5
Great coat at a great price. Bought this for my mother. Loved it so much I bought one for my daughter and myself.|5
I bought and received this coat recently. It was too small. I returned it to the Burlington that is close to me. I ordered a larger one on the phone, and am very excited about receiving it.|5
Perfect for Spring, not too heavy not too light. Good material quality. Love this jacket for lighter days.|5
Perfect jacket! Excellent quality, looks sharp, and feels and wears awesome. Fit is right on. Excellent find and on sale was even better.
Love it.|5

Love it.|5
I've been looking for a red coat and I found this one. It's nice and warm which is a great feature in New England. I don't like the extra phony pockets on the outside of the chest area, but I can live with them because the rest of the coat is wonderful. Nice and warm, stylish, looks great, feels great. Does run a bit small so I had to get the next size up but that's ok. Good value for the money. And it has a detachable hood. Another great feature.|5
True to the picture the quality surpass the expectation.|5
Great little jacket, fits perfect, soft leather,( I had wondered about that). Wasn't sure about the color it's not cream, or tan. Hard to describe but it's not bad.|5
I really like this jacket. It fits fine and it keeps me warm. I live in Maine and we have some pretty cold winters. I like the style of this jacket. It looks nice. It's a 3-in-1 jacket so it has a gray interior liner that you can wear by itself during the spring or early fall. The outer shell can be worn by itself as well. The outer shell will make a good raincoat as it's waterproof. You won't need to buy any other seasonal jackets because the components of this jacket can suit your needs during all seasons.|5
so pleased with this lovely warm coat...great to cuddle in when its frigid outside|5
Can't wait to wear it. Haven't worn it yet but when I do I will be warm.|5
I ordered this in a small and it fit perfectly with room bundle up even more. it is nice and heavy but not bulky. I love the Fleece lining! I will love the winters even more now!|5
Was really surprised that the coat was warm and beautiful|5
I got a great deal on this coat and I love it so much!|5
Love the coat well worth it fits great keeps me warm during cold weather|5
I love this jacket. It fits perfect! The quality and style was exact to order.|5
I bouth this jacket for my daughter and she loved nice and warm.|5
Bought for a Christmas gift, it was a big hit! Every girl there wanted one!!|5
my wife loves the coat. it made me feel good to see her smile.|5
I haven't had a chance to wear it yet as its Texas and still getting to 80 degrees here but I have been looking for a military style coat for a year and finally found a good one at a good price! Fits true to size, I ordered the medium and it's perfect. Good weight to the coat and I love all the detailing. So happy with this purchase.|5
I ordered it online and was happy when I got it because it fit perfectly. It keeps me warm and it has a hood in case it rains, an added bonus. I like that it has a zipper and I like the color.|5
This jacket feels amazing. It keeps me very warm, it's very good for the cold weather|5
I bought these Items about an month ago and everything fits perfect*********|5
Coat came just in time for our first cold spell. It was a perfect fit and very very warm!|5
I was happy to find this coat as a last minute purchase and for a great sale price. It has a pleasing fit with an attached non-removable belt for cinching which creates a nice definition so you don't look too bulky. It definitely keeps you warm with both a zipper and button up and the pockets were deep to keep hands covered above wrists, they also each have a button to keep closed when not in use. The inner mesh pocket was useful for carrying other items.|5
My only issues were with the hood which would slide off with or without wearing a knitted hat; it had no way of being tightened to stay in place when facing gusting winds. When it did stay on the faux fur would cover my eyes and become a nuisance but folding over this part helped somewhat. Even though it is a detachable zippered hood I left it on in hopes that it would serve its purpose even occasionally during wear.|5
Overall, it's a great jacket at a great value and I would purchase again if needed.|5
I ordered this for a ski trip to Denver. Though I haven't skied in it yet, I'm so pleased with the fit and the quality. I love the adjustable waist, and there are plenty of pockets. Hood is also removable. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a warm winter coat that's fashionable as well!|4
I bought my all weather jacket for Christmas. It was easy to order, great for the rain (totally dry) and I have not been cold in the snow! I even had a 2 day shipment. Thank you.|5
This is my new coat. It keeps me warm and it's the right height for me.|5
The only thing I wish is that it had a zipper that would zip up from the bottom for sitting in the car, it is also hard to zip, which is why I only gave four stars.|4
Looks nice. It appeared to be a- little more roomy than I expected. Overall I liked the length and the look of this coat|5
I'm new to Burlington Coat Factory. A friend sent me here. The coat is truly a warm welcome blessing.|5
It was better than I thought! I love the material. It is comfortable and simply elegant.|5
Beautiful Coat. Too big and you did not have a smaller size...|5
It was really great, I loved how many pockets it came with and also the suspenders on the inside to give added support. Over all great coat, just gotta wait to break it in once winter actually starts haha.|5
i bought this jacket for xmas i know he will lovw item this is my 2nd jacket from your co. i know he ll love itburlington have great products looking forward foing more business in the future.... karen|5
I bought this jacket as a much needed Christmas gift for my husband. He loves it! It's perfect for those cold drizzly days. Especially since the fur lining on the hood is detachable!|5
This jacket answers the need for warmth. It is stylish and has storage galore. The price was awsome and way lower then what it would cost in retail stores.|5
Got it for brother and dad for their fishing adventures. Quality is great! Warm and they loves it!|5
I bought 2 jackets in black for birthday presents and they loved them,|5
I brought my coat about a month ago and I am totally satisfied|5
This is a beautiful coat!!! I'm glad I picked the Tall version for my 6'3" boyfriend. It fits him perfectly except for the waistband, which is a little snug and is not elastic. However, he can still get it zipped and leather, even faux leather, tends to stretch out over time so I'm not worried. There were a few loose threads along the zipper upon arrival, but they were easily removed. It's really soft and very attractive, and hopefully will last a long time.|5
I love this Jacket! It's sad, that other department stores, don't offer amazing choices for Big & Tall. I will cherish this coat for years to come!|5
I bought this item a few weeks ago. I thoroughly enjoyed the jacket. Thank you for timely delivery, nice look and great fit.|5
I bought this for a Christmas present for my son and he loves it.|5
Am very happy with the online ordering process and love my coat|5
I bought it a week ago and it is warm, waterproof, and very flexible|5
We needed a sturdy, warm jacket for an active boy and kids coats were not lasting. This is a sturdy, well built jacket that should last the season.|5
Had this new jacket for about three weeks and very pleased with it and it looks sharp! I bought the blue with black accents.|5
I live the jacket it runs big but I like that since I dress in layers|5
I bought it for my son, he wasn't cold at all when he was standing out in the elements . He is 6'4 and the length of the jacket and arms were perfect|5
Just got it a few weeks ago. It's good and warm and flexible to remove the hood and fur and comfortable to wear. Worth the money.|5
My mom and I purchased this for my brother in AZ. He works outside in the evenings. He says that it is wonderful so far!|5
Bought 5 winter coats for my grandsons and was very happy with the fit and the design also the quality of all 5 coats.|5
I bought this coat as a gift and the person bought for loves it. It's full and warm so it has no need really for any extra layering or anything like that. They also said it's optional to wear a hat because the hood is so warm and full as well. Overall the coat was a great buy and the sizing is accurate and the color (ice) is beautiful!|5
This coat is great! Very warm, great for Winter and looks better in person than online.|5
Fit the boyfriend wonderfully and is still keeping him warm.|5
I bought this jacket for my husband and he loves it.|5
Purchased this jacket for my 11 year old son who is tall and slim in a large...fits him perfect and will last him for 2-3 more years...this coat was perfect in weight and look...this is his Sunday wear coat for cold mornings to church.|5
My son loves his new ski jacket he said it is so warm. Fits great.|5
I bought this as a gift and the receiver loved the jacket. The puffer style and the blue color look great and the light weight and warmth were perfect for the weather here.|5
Beautiful Jacket! Light, durable and stylish.
I bought my husband a new jacket to replace an old one he had for years.
He just loves it.|5
I very recently received it. Seems like a good quality jacket.|5
Jacket is light weight and well made. Just what I wanted.|5
Great Jacket! Would recommend this jacket to anyone.|5

I bought this jacket for my nephew and he absolutely loved the look and fit of the jacket. The quality was great for the price! We were both very happy with the jacket and shipping was super fast! I will definitely buy again on line!|5
Bought this for Christmas for my grandson, he loves it. The fit was perfect. Perfect for my 15 year old who likes to layer, not bulky, but keeps him warm.|5
The jacket really blocks wind and keeps the cold out. I just wasn't crazy about the hood. It doesn't quite sit right on your head. The pockets are deep too|5
This is a very good coat for any kind of storm around east coast!|5
Very nice price. Runs a little big but you have to wear it in top of your clothes.|5
Not bulky but still warm. Fits true to size. Very nice look. Bought for a teenage boy who loved it|5
I bought this a month ago and so glad I did. Thanks|5
I got the jacket at a great price and it shipped quickly.|5
The lining is really nice to the skin, much warming than I thought on a winding day, and the arm length is what I needed.|5
The silk lining she likes
The color combo she loves
Durable zipper / snaps
Thick
Affordable|5
I bought this as a gift for my cousin. She's about 85 pounds and 5 feet tall. The arms are a little long but she loves it. It's very soft and thick so it makes for a good winter coat without being too bulky.|5
Great value and beautiful style! My daughter loves it...|5

I bought these Items about an month ago and everything fits perfect*********|5
I needed a lightwright coat suitable for outside bus duty and my winter coat is too heavy now. This coat fits perfectly, is long enough for being covered in the rain, and has a hood. My daughter said she really liked it too! I bought it in Navy-size small. I wear a 6 in ladies and am 5' 5". At this price, I can get another!|5
Wasnt expecting it to fit me ..but it did! and it looks awesome! mine is Green-Military. Light not heavy. Good shipping and fast! Recommend it!|5
I ordered this jacket in black and I love it. It's very stylish and you can't beat the price. I ordered a small and it fits great.|5
Very well made and the length is good. Lots of pockets for when you're traveling. Runs small so order a size up.|5
This jacket is trendy and is a great length. The only thing is that the hood comes too far over the eyes when the hood is on, but other than that the jacket fits well and is light weight.|4
Love the fabric and design, too bad I didn't pay special attention to the Junior size, got a 2XL but still too small.|5
Purchased this jacket in black and its perfect for this Houston bipolar weather!!|5
It looks perfect on me. Whenever I wear it, people keep asking me where I got it|5
I thought that it would be too small since it was Jr. Plus. And I would've had to take it to the store for an exchange. But it fitted perfect. With a little more room to spare.|5
I brought this coat a month ago and I absolutely love it...I recommend anyone to purchase this coat|5
I purchased a size 2X online so I'd have enough room to wear sweaters or layers but coat fitted too large so I returned it to the store which was a smooth process hoping to get a smaller size but it wasn't available. However, the coat was nice looking and would of kept me warm.|4
This coat is super warm and lightweight. I'm glad I bought it. Fits perfectly. I'm a busty woman & I have no problems with zipping.|5
I wish that I would have purchased it in black too. This coat is super light and super warm. I LOVE the holes in the sleeve for my thumb.|5
I just got my jacket a week ago and I love the way it looks on me|5
I bought a coat about a month ago - good purchase.|4
Got the medium size and it just fits right. Im petite 5'0 $130lbs. Love the style especially the price. If you want room for thick shirt or sweater get the Large. I live in a state where its no cold all the time. So I only use light shirt underneath.|5
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it, but beware - it runs a little small.|4
This is a very nice looking jacket, I wish I could have fit in it. Very stylish|5
I just bought this tonight in store
omg so very warm|5
Purchased online and am very happy with the fit and look. I only wish I qualified for the free shipping.|4
I bought this for myself a couple of weeks ago. I love it, however it runs very small.|4
I brought this a few weeks ago it's warm and I liked the style of it.that shipping was great to with a few days I received my product love it..I got it at a reasonable price too|4
I bought this coat last week just before it got cold. Perfect to wear now, kept me warm and comfortable.|5
It's soo comfortable, and very warm. I received a lot of compliments about it|5
Bought the cost but I had to send it back to small.|3
Roomy and adjustable, this cute rain slicker is a must! The fit is true to size and has ability to cinch at the waist if you want a more form flattering silhouette. The only disappointments were the false top pockets and dummy zippers. The pockets below the waist are deep and can easily stash a large cellphone like the note 4 or 6 plus.|4
I ordered this a few weeks ago for a weekend getaway when I found out it might be rainy. It came within a few days, it fit perfectly (I just went by the size guide in the website, taking measurements) and is even more attractive in person. It was good for rainy and windy conditions. Great find for such a reasonable price!|5
I bought this jacket, but i wish the jackets top pockets were actual pockets|3
when this coat arrived, i was not impressed with it in the package, but once I put it on, I was so happy I bought it. it is all about the fit with this coat and it is very complimentary|5
Nice coat, shipped promptly but sadly was too small. Seemed to run a bit small.|3
I bought this jacket about a month ago! It has been pretty good so far.|4
Great size shape and color. Exactly what I needed and wanted|5
When buying this jacket, it does run super small, I usually wear a medium however I had to buy an extra large for this jacket to fit.|4
I purchase this coat for my daughter. She loves it, however, in my opinion a little on the thin side. The hood fits snug around the face.|4

I bought them for my daughters and theye really love them|4
Warm, cozy, and very fashionable. Bought it for my niece and she loves it! Definitely going back to Burlington !|4
Only had it for a month but satisfied with the outcome.|5
I wish it was a little longer but overall great purchase!!!!!! The fur on the hood is very soft and fits well|5
This coat is ok, but they sewed the fur into the seam on the hood. I wear it sans hood.|3
I ordered this coat last month and it had 5 holes in it and day to day the holes got bigger and bigger the quality of this coat is so cheap it will keep you warm. Alittle but you will not survive and wett weather with thia coat i rate 0|1
I bought this coat two weeks ago for my daughter. I love the color. My daughter loves the coat. It fits her perfectly. I would certainly recommend it to others.|5
Good looking jacket but not quite warm enough even with a sweater underneath. Good for wearing in a car. The collar is warm but the zipper is not covered therefore it's annoying and cold. Also didn't like the strings hanging from the back of the jacket|3
I bought this about a couple of months ago and it fits my 15yr old daughter well!|3
Love the coat, fits perfectly, light weight and not bulky.|5
I saw this jacket in another store and could never find my size and was double the price! Looked on Burlington's website and I find it in my size for $25! I wore it to my works Christmas party and it was a hit!|5
I usually wear a "small" but ordered a "medium" and it was ridiculously small - like for a child. I was so disappointed.|1
When I selected this jacket was looking forward to it cause it has the hoodie come to find out is not women size was sad about it|1
It's a great buy for the quality and cost
I will purchase another one for my other daughter for Christmas mo NJ|5
I thought a Junior large I could wear but I actually need a XL even though bust said 38.5 inches. Loved the jacket probably have daughter try it on before I have to return it to the store. Love the color, the crop length. I usually wear a woman's large.|3
This coat was ok...I purchased the grey one for my daughter who has no problem wearing a Medium Junior size...so we went up to a size large hoping she might be able to wear it next year. This "coat" runs WAY SMALL! The sleeves were 2 inches too short and when she raised her arms the bottom of the coat showed her belly button, and there was no way she was gonna be able to cross her arms if bundled up. We've purchased several coats lately from Burlington and all of them seem to run very small. This will make 2 that I have had to return due to not fitting and it's really just not worth it, I won't be buying from here again. Also, this is more like a heavy jacket...hardly heavy enough to call a coat.|3
This coat runs very small! Now I have to return it!!!|1
I bought this in the size I usually buy that will cover a ladies suit or sweaters. It was so small that it wouldn't even close. It was not available 3 sizes larger or I would have rebought, It was a beautiful, soft coat.|1
I purchased this coat about 2 weeks ago and the coat has now began to show snags and it has busted on the side.I would like to be refunded my money or get anot her coat of my choice...|1
What a smart idea, that the hood comes off and the inside polar tech can be woren as a jacket. It's perfect for Arizona weather. From very cold to mild weather.|5
Item matched color and description. Runs a little small but I bought big so all is good!|5
I had been hunting for this very coat for weeks. It was a Christmas gift for my Girl fiends daughter and she was trilled with it.|5
Was very pleased with the quality and looks of the jacket.|5
This very cute Crop Denim Vest has just the right touch of decorative treatment! It can be paired with a wide variety of garments so you can get as creative as you want! Really like this one!|5
I bought this for my two year old and it fits perfectly. It appears like it will last at least another winter.|5
A gift for my grand-daughter. Her mom loved it & the price was really good!|5
Fit really nice. My daughter is 5 yrs but shes really skinny and wears 4. So this size 4 fit really good and was long enough for her. She play with the snow, ski and wear the jacket alone with no problem. Warm enough and the water never when thru her cloth. Love it. The hoodie didn't cover her entire head or stood on. But she's too hyper anyway. And i put her a beanie.|5
Purchased this and in less thank 2 weeks it arrived thank you|5
We got this coat for my daughter who is a fashionista and she loves it , mom can wear it when she outgrows it !!!|5
Bough as a gift and these are super cute and matched the coat perfectly.|5
Great quality and so cute! My 7 year old loves it!|5
My daughter was happy on her new vest. Got it for $10.99 clearance!|5
I bought this item around 3 weeks ago I'm to fall in love with it my baby looks beautiful with it|5
so i bought this jacket for my daughter. she smile and gave me call to let me know she was very happy with the jacket, she is 10|5
I bought this for my granddaughter and it's exactly what she wanted. When she wears it Christmas Day I hope she likes it.|4
This product was a great value and actually a better quality than what I thought it would be|5
My daughter was lacking a good functional winter coat. I searched online and found nothing with style and wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg. I finally rememembered burlington and I am so glad I did. For less than 15 dollars how could I pass this coat up. Its stylish and the lining inside is so warm! I was very impressed with the material inside and out. My little girl even got compliments from her friends moms and asked where we found it. Definitely a great buy!|5
Purchased for gift...very pleased.
Would purchase again.

I bought this for my grand daughter for Christmas. It's lighter weight than I thought it would be but it's still cute. I bought others for my older grand daughters on another site that were heavier and a better buy than this but they didn't have one in her size.|3
I'm again impressed by the quality of the material and the price was a bargain! My daughter has worn this every day since purchase, if though the weather has been very unusual for December.|4
Vivid red and so cute on... worn to a formal Christmas occasion and received a lot of compliments|5
A very cute coat. It fits my little girl perfectly. The only thing was that it came with a hat instead of a scarf. I ordered the coat in purple. The picture shows the coat in pink with the hat. I bought the coat with the description as saying it came with a scarf. No complaints really...I just thought the writers should know.|5
The coat is cute and fits my daughter well. This did not actually come with a scarf though...only a hat. The hat is cute but I wish the scarf was actually included.|3
Great product and price. I will recommend to friends.|4
It really warm but a bit smaller than I expected. It very nice for it price|4
My daughter really wanted a coat that was a little longer. This one was perfect. It hasn't been super cold yet, but so far she's been warm at the bus stop in the morning.|4
My girl really like it this jacket it's very cute!!!|4
Too small. Not true to size. Will not fit her for only a month or so.|1
Bought it for my son for a trip to Utah in the snow. He was warm and dry the whole time! Well worth it!|5
Bought this jacket a few weeks ago for my 9 year old son. Bought a size large, it's a little too big but any added layering and it's perfect. Also will fit perfect for the new fall/winter this year! Great deal, gear buy!|5
I bought this for next Christmas for my grandson, so it's not been worn yet. It looks and feels like it will definitely keep him warm. I like the style, the choice of colors, and especially the price offered here.|5
I bought the double jacket to replace a similar one my son had for 2 years n grew out off. When he put it on one 32 degree day, said wow really warm, n loved it. Best Buy and very versatile.|5
Great Coat; the 3-1 feature allows him an option to wear the coat and the vest or just the vest with a hoodie|5
I was trying to find a good quality coat for my son in the burlington store but there was only two left that he couldn't fit, so I went to the site and it has more of a selection. Glad I ordered online. I would Definately recommend this coat!|5

I bought this jacket last winter for my son. He loved it the second he put it on and when we were sledding he always said he was very warm. Somehow we lost it and thankfully I found it here, reordered it right away street a long day of online searching. This jacket was the best jacket I got my son I had to get him another one. If you want your little one to stay warm search no further.|5
Picked up this Jacket for my grandson. Was pleasantly surprised when I seen that the lining was warm and extremely soft.|5

Excellent buy! It looks great and the quality is excellent. Very happy with purchase.|5
This is a wonderful purchase, great quality! Material is perfect!|5
I bought this for my son. Jacket is much better looking than the pic shows. Seems warm and looks nice. The only issue is that I came to me with a hole in the collar and none of the stores have a replacement and they are out of the correct size online. I have waited three weeks and they haven't gotten any more in stock.|4
I got this jacket for my son when we had the sudden change in the Texas weather it was a perfect fit and it met all expectations! !|5

Just brought the coat for my nine year old, and he loves it.|4
I bought this jacket because it looked very warm and heavy enough to block any wind or cold. I was correct my son is nestled in and it is very durable|4
I purchased this coat about 2 weeks ago, and when boy tried it on, he loved it!!! mostly because of the vest included.|4
I thought this coat had more installation. It was too light for very cold temperatures. Good for mild cold days.|3
I bought this coat in hopes it'll last my sons a couple years. When my son wore it once the zipper would go up but unzip while the zipper was up. I'm very unsatisfied with your product!|2
I purchased the coat a week ago. I love it. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my baby girl but it's too nice to wait until then. I'm not a pink and purple kind of girl. Online it looked kind of ugly. When I got it, I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. I am very pleased with the heaviness of the coat and the look is gorgeous. We live in Chicago and I always buy my kids coats from Burlington. This is my baby girls first winter and she's going to be nice a d warm in her very first winter coat.|5
Perfect Christmas presents. They arrived right on time. Definitely will do it again!|5
Purchased this and in less thank 2 weeks it arrived thank you|5
I liked the jacket, I thought that it had a zipper but the only thing that I don't like is that the button will not stay button and there is no zipper.|5
The coat was much nicer than I expected. The fabric was nice and soft, just right for a little girl. My granddaughter looked so cute for Easter!|5
I bought this item around 3 weeks ago I'm to fall in love with it my baby looks beautiful with it|5
Very well made and great for Fall weather and chilly days|4

great jacket. I love the style of the jacket with the hood|5
Good quality and fine workmanship. I especially liked the flap of material covering the top of the zipper so it won't pinch the baby's neck when it's closed. Very pleased with the value for a very good price. I would recommend this jacket.|5
