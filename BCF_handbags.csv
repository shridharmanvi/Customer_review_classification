Great organizer. It's slightly bigger than a regular wallet. You can grab this and run in the store if you don't want to carry your whole purse.|5
Love it the price is great better than other stores|5

I purchased this ring a month ago and I am very pleased with it, It is gorgeous, the picture does not do justice.I recommend this.|5
I'm so happy with this purchase beautiful ring!! Love it, true to size!|5
I love the length, not to long, not too short.....|5
I bought this set of 3 earrings to go on vacation and it was nice that they are 3 totally different looks so I could wear a different pair each night!|5
my granddaughter was looking for something to go with an outfit. this is going to be perfect, can't wait for her to see it.|5
Fast service,quick delivery,easy, just open laptop and easy to see products. Items, when open, are what they looked like when ordered.|5
I bought these earrings for my daughter and they are beautiful!. They are bigger than I expected but nonetheless, very beautiful. Now I need a pair for me :)|5
Exceeded my expectations, simply glamorous bling, bling|5
Absolutely beautiful and comfortable to wear. Love it|5
I purchased these online for my wife, they were very attractive and large hoops as stated , but no where on the pieces was there a sterling silver stamping which gives rise to the possibility that they are not,... unless you see them in the store or absolutely verified as Sterling Silver in the future , I would ask questions.|3
Ring could have at least been in a box or something instead of taped plastic|3
2 pair were the same color, 1 pair was a different color. I have 3 holes in each ear, so it looks funny wearing them all together|3
This item is an exceptional value. However, I cannot wear the hoops; they are way too big.|2
Great price, attractive piece, authentic coin,cool..|4
I purchased this curling iron for myself for Christmas. It was wrapped and under the tree, but I was so excited to try it, I opened it before Christmas. It was a total disappointment. It's very, very hard to use. I'm not a beautician, but I've been curling/styling my hair all my life. I KNOW how to use a curling iron. OH, it did curl my hair. Unfortunately, the curl was wonky, curled the wrong direction and with funky marks on my hair. Also, I did slightly burn my finger once and the palm of my hand as well. No major burns thank goodness. I was also thinking of purchasing this form my 13 year old grand-daughter. I won't after my personal experience with it. I'll be shipping this back very soon.|1
it was a gift. the person did give me feedback. I 'm like, I have wanted to have one like this|3
light enough for summer wear. Works well over braided hair|4

I very happy with my slippers. The are very soft and comfortable.|5
Great socks very comfy would recommend these to anyone|2
I was pleased with the fit and comfort of the belt.|5
It's an okay belt. It's nothing special. It's an extra accessory.|2
I searched the Web for similar items and these were a fraction of the cost.|5
it was good for my civic car. I just wish they have black ones.|5
Wallet is exactly as pictured. If it's the style you're looking for, you will be happy with it.|5
Looks good on my car. overall the prize is great! And quality look good. I have used them for 2 weeks.|5
American coin treasures santa money clips. Purchased as giflts. They appear well made, sturdy and attrative.|5
Super good value! Best value for the money. I may buy more later|5
Very well made! Very stylish, I get several compliments!|5
I bought this for my son as a stocking stuffer, he had been growing a beard since the first of November. Well he went into the bathroom to try it out and shaved nearly all of his face off. He loved the product so much he couldn't stop with the trimming. He looks good with what he has now not the bear he had became.|5
These worked out great! Just what was needed and they will be used. Easier to iron than 100 percent cotton. Should have bought another packet. Arrived in time for the birthday and great quality.|5
This purchase was a Christmas gift for my son. He said he didn't want a bulky scarf and this set was perfect.|5
I bought this an month ago and my lover was happy, thank you for the on time shipping|5
Satisfied w/products size, value, color & apperances|4
Nice quality and good value. Would highly recommend|4
The socks are terrific and fit perfectly. I'm glad I purchased two packs. The multiple colors go well with different colored outfits. Less sweaty feet while exercising.|5
My daughter and i both love it. The sz is great with braids and warm enough for the cold too. It has become her college staple head gear. Got it in grey went back for the brown and there was no more :-). heart broken|5
I needed a new hat. I love it. The button sits it off.|5
I love it. Can't wait to wear it. Going to buy one for my sister|5

I have been buying these for years! The fit is great and they are comfortable. The control top holds your tummy in makes you look thinner. My favorite color is the Misty Taupe. I highly recommend these panty hose to you are long lasting and very durable. I wash them in the washer and hang them up to dry. Great price too!|5
I love these pantyhose--attractive, yet supportive. They massage your legs all day and look great! The problem is their poor availability--both online and in the stores. When they do arrive in the stores, they are immediately hoarded. especially in the Wild Rice color. When they are featured online, there is very poor selection, especially in the same color. Typically only one or two pairs in white are available. Unfortunately, I am a teacher who needs to stand all day, not a nurse!|5
I have been wearing this brand of hosiery for about 20 years and it is the best on the market. I get worried when I go to the store and not find them in stock! Please stock more of these in all of your stores as I travel a lot and stop at all of the Burlington stores. Thanks.|5
I have been buying Burlington Control Top Pantyhose for most of my life. They last longer than any other pantyhose on the market. Please don't stop making this product. They are Great!|5
I have been buying these hose for 25 years and just found out that they are being discontinued. I quickly ran around Memphis the other day 3 stores all being between 25 and 35 miles from my house. I bought what was left in myour size. 17 pairs in all. I really wish that they do not discontinue them. They outlast all other brands.|5
I love these! Only ones I have bought for the last 33 years! Whenever I can find them, I admit---I buy all they have in my size in the Black, Off Black, and Misty Taupe! Great quality, great price, great value. I hope they never discontinue them. I only wish I could find them in the stores more frequently.|5
This is better than shopping in the store!!! - They are always out of my size and the color. I love this color - no other brand has anything this close and its durable - I get several wears out of 1 pair.|5
I buy 10 pair every time I go to the store. I am ordering some one line today to save a trip. They look good and really last I am tall and plus size, so it is hard to find hose that fit well.
Thank you|5
